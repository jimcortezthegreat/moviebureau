The series, which stars John Cena as the titular hero/antihero, is a direct spinoff from James Gunn's The Suicide Group, and follows the vicious mercenary as he is recruited by Amanda Waller's A.R.G.U.S. to join another black ops squad. They've been tasked with dealing with an extraterrestrial menace in the shape of parasitic butterfly-like organisms who've taken up residence in human bodies.</p>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <div>\n                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Gunn established the tone for his series with an exhilarating, choreographed introduction dance sequence set to Wig Wam's \"Do You Wanna Taste It?\" Gunn set the tone for his series with an exhilarating, choreographed introductory dance sequence set to Wig Wam's \"Do You Wanna Taste It?\" \"No kidding, we shot the actual opening in a school auditorium not so different from that,\" Gunn said to a tweet showing the sequence being reproduced for a high-school talent competition.</p>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <div class=\"ArticleBody_twitter__xokII\">\n                <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">No kidding, we shot the actual opening in a school auditorium not so different from that. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Peacemaker?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc^tfw\">#Peacemaker</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/S9IsLv8ReU\">https://t.co/S9IsLv8ReU</a></p>— James Gunn (@JamesGunn) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JamesGunn/status/1507732545470971905?ref_src=twsrc^tfw\">March 26, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n                </div>","\n                <div>\n                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Peacemaker has already been renewed for a second season, so fans will be interested to see what happens with the beginning dance sequence as fresh episodes air. Given that several of the characters from the original scene are no longer alive, such as Annie Chang's Detective Sophie Song and Robert Patrick's Auggie Smith, the sequence is likely to be re-choreographed and re-filmed. The launch date for Peacemaker season 2 has yet to be revealed, so fans may have to wait a while to watch more of John Cena's dance moves.</p>\n                </div>\n                "]},"reco":[{"id":"f3a18b76-fab6-40a5-946f-b0c36079bb14","date":"May 20, 2022","author":"Brian Martin","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52085954343_8b563cb528_o.png","title":"Quentin Tarantino Discusses How John Carpenter's 'The Thing' Influenced the Making of 'Reservoir Dogs’","tags":"movie news","excerpt":"And why one of the few films that scares him is 'The Thing.’"},{"id":"ea5bcadb-6b70-41d4-aace-29cfb3824434","date":"May 18, 2022","author":"Brian Martin","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52082671695_1bbb5391a0_c.jpg","title":"Where Did 'The Godfather Part IV' Go?
