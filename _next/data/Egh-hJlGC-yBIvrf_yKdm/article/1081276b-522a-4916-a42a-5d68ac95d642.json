While no official announcement has been made, fans can expect another season of the immensely popular sports anime at some point in the future.</pre>","<pre class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>The anime follows Hinata Shoyou, a fiery middle school girl who is madly in love with volleyball, and is based on the manga by Haruichi Furudate. His tiny size isn't ideal for a volleyball player, but that doesn't stop him from aspiring to be the best of them all, especially when it comes to defeating the lanky star-athlete Kageyama Tobio, dubbed the \"King of the Court.\" Volleyball matches that are thrilling, fantastic characters, dynamic art, and appealing comedy are just a few of the reasons why this series is so popular.</pre>","\n                <div class='ArticleBody_imageContainer__ktXae'>\n                <img src=\"https://animenewsandfacts.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Haikyuu-Season-4-Episode-18.jpg\" alt=\"anime, sports, volleyball, haikyuu, hinata\">\n                </div>","<pre class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Season 4 concludes with the episode \"The Promised Land,\" which follows the Karasuno and Inarizaki High School teams in their second match of the Spring Nationals. For a variety of reasons, this is the most difficult game the Karasuno team has had to play in the series. Inarizaki, for example, was able to duplicate Hinata and Kageyama's special rapid attack, leaving the team baffled as to how to counter it.</pre>","\n                <div class='ArticleBody_related__oI_Nm'>\n                <p class='ArticleBody_relatedCap__07hkO'>RELATED:</p>\n                <a class='ArticleBody_relatedTitle__uyeq1' href='https://www.themoviebureau.com/article/2a353adb-5a82-48c6-bac1-c7d341b195a6'>Top 15 Greatest Sports Anime of All Time</a>\n                </div>\n                ","<pre class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>The Karasuno team came out on top in this arduous match with an unexpected mega-victory.\nThe last episode depicted how each team dealt with the aftermath of the game. A meeting against Karasasuno's long-time nemesis, Nekoma High School, is also on the horizon.</pre>","\n                <div class='ArticleBody_imageContainer__ktXae'>\n                <img src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/b1713c30-7bf7-4d3f-83bb-9014541fbe26\" alt=\"anime, sports, volleyball, haikyuu, hinata\">\n                </div>","<pre class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Season 4 ended in December 2020, therefore there has been no official word on the fifth season for nearly a year. Haikyuu!! seasons have been delayed in the past, including a four-year gap between the third and fourth seasons, with season 4 being postponed owing to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWith the show's history of delays, it's no surprise that season 5 will be delayed as well, especially since the season 4 conclusion was over a year ago. At this time, there is no word on when Season 5 will be released.</pre>","<pre class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>This isn't to suggest that a fifth season won't be made. The anime's Twitter page stated that they were \"looking forward to the continuation,\" implying that season 5 will be arriving on our screens very soon. The reason for the fifth season's delay has been revealed to be COVID-19.</pre>","\n                <div class='ArticleBody_imageContainer__ktXae'>\n                <img src=\"https://i.pinimg.com/736x/2c/29/d9/2c29d9785d24b6ff4d3491d368ce5291.jpg\" alt=\"anime, sports, volleyball, haikyuu, hinata\">\n                </div>","<pre class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Season 4 concluded on a massive cliffhanger, causing a social media frenzy with fans nearly asking for season 5 to air. Season 5 will undoubtedly cover the aftermath of the thrilling encounter against Inarizaki, as well as the imminent rematch against Nekoma High.</pre>","<pre class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>The manga predicts that in chapter 293, Karasuno would face off against Nekoma in the famed \"Battle At The Garbage Dump.\" Both sides have only played practice matches against each other, so a significant match between them will be thrilling to witness. In a flashback, the same chapter also reveals the animosity between Coach Ukai and Coach Nekomata. Hinata's love for volleyball was kindled by a player known as the Little Giant, and if the manga is to be believed, Hinata will meet him in season 5.</pre>","\n                <div class='ArticleBody_relatedNext__4ybLJ'>\n                <p class='ArticleBody_relatedCap__07hkO'>READ NEXT:</p>\n                <a class='ArticleBody_relatedTitle__uyeq1' href='da2ac8ca-4ac5-408f-b8e9-9d64a98bb5fc'>Popular Basketball Anime Slam Dunk Returns Fall 2022</a>\n                </div>\n                "]},"reco":[{"id":"34e061d6-e747-4446-87b6-9e6618fbf51e","date":"Apr 11, 2022","author":"Andres Pineda","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51997523665_55c2a0f398_c.jpg","title":"The Best Filipino Movies That You Need To Watch","tags":"movie news","excerpt":"In this article, we look into Filipino films and cinema, which is undoubtedly one of Southeast Asia's most underrated businesses."},{"id":"6d8df57f-04ce-496f-b891-06c8208020ec","date":"Apr 11, 2022","author":"Wallace Bell","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51997038444_e1d6e422c3_c.jpg","title":"Season 4 Of Stranger Things Is Similar To Game Of Thrones, According To The Creators","tags":"tv news","excerpt":"While discussing Stranger Things season 4, the Duffer Brothers make a comparison between the Netflix series and Game of Thrones."},{"id":"9a3f668d-e089-420d-8e6b-0f1249b897c2","date":"Apr 11, 2022","author":"Nick Carver","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51996780953_7e35495503_c.jpg","title":"Best Basketball Movies That You Should Start Watching","tags":"movie news","excerpt":"Basketball on the big screen isn't always a win, but when it comes to hoops in Hollywood, these films are the genuine MVPs."},{"id":"4b4d9d1e-d36f-4d42-a371-d5be789313a8","date":"Apr 7, 2022","author":"Nick Carver","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51988471790_f1d8861371_c.jpg","title":"The Director of Avengers: Endgame Explains Why Marvel Movies Have So Much Humor","tags":"movie news","excerpt":"As Kevin Feige is aware of what people appreciate, Joe Russo explains that the secret to Marvel's success is the usage of comedy in their films."}]},"__N_SSG":true}
