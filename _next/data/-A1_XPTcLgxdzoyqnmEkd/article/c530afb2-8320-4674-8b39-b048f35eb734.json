The first Pirates of the Caribbean film, released in 2003, was a huge smash with audiences and launched a multi-billion-dollar franchise. Captain Jack Sparrow, played by Johnny Depp, was introduced to viewers in Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, a beloved figure who would go on to feature in all four sequels, the most recent of which, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales, was released in 2017.</p>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <div>\n                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>The possibility of a sixth Pirates of the Caribbean film has been discussed since before the fifth, but no new information has been released about the project in a long time. The production of a sixth Pirates of the Caribbean film might possibly be hampered by Depp's current legal issues. The 58-year-old actor's troubled marriage with ex-wife Amber Heard has long been the topic of tabloid headlines, and the two stars' bitter spat has now moved to the courtroom, with Depp suing Heard for $50 million in defamation.</p>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <div>\n                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Depp's evidence in court against Heard included an unexpected admission: he'd never seen Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, according to Matthew Belloni, creator of Puck News. Belloni considers Depp's admission \"a baller move,\" noting that he was nominated for Best Actor at the 2004 Academy Awards for his performance as Sparrow.</p>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <div class=\"ArticleBody_twitter__xokII\">\n                <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Johnny Depp just said in court he never saw the first PIRATES movie.

Depp, who has previously stated that he does not enjoy viewing his own films, joins the ranks of Meryl Streep, Joaquin Phoenix, Javier Bardem, and Reese Witherspoon as performers who skip their own films. While it may seem strange that Depp didn't see a film for which he was nominated for an Academy Award, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl appears to be only the latest in a long series of Depp films that he hasn't seen.</p>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <div>\n                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>It's unclear how Depp's current legal issues will affect the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise's future. Even said, it's becoming increasingly improbable that Depp would reprise his role as Captain Jack Sparrow. The Pirates of the Caribbean series may have to learn to thrive without Depp's presence, with a spinoff reportedly in production with Margot Robbie attached to feature. Many fans believe the latter episodes are notably worse than Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl and the other two original trilogy films, therefore it could be a good thing for the franchise to receive a fresh start.</p>\n                </div>\n                "]},"reco":[{"id":"a7d55ce3-8163-4dd5-80a3-d2f31c9b89b1","date":"Jul 25, 2022","author":"Brian Martin","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52239396903_e24b96945b_o.png","title":"Is Daredevil: Born Again in the MCU Going to Be As Dark as the Comics?","tags":"tv news","excerpt":"The speculated fourth season of Daredevil has a title that begs many more questions than it answers."},{"id":"752f6e9c-cfc6-413b-af02-bbae594c1c78","date":"Jul 21, 2022","author":"Brian Martin","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52231320065_743420415e_o.png","title":"The Reason Why Game of Thrones Spinoff Bloodmoon Was Canceled","tags":"tv news","excerpt":"The original concept for a Game of Thrones spinoff from HBO was bold and unique but maybe too much."},{"id":"9a6591fc-ad8b-4b29-9122-3ecb7f3f955a","date":"Jul 19, 2022","author":"Brian Martin","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52226487424_7ec3187363_o.png","title":"Best Korean Horror Films That You Should Watch","tags":"movie news","excerpt":"Since decades, South Korea has produced excellent motion pictures and television shows, particularly in the horror category."},{"id":"b21195fa-f5aa-476d-9b96-1b88d1231aed","date":"Jul 15, 2022","author":"Brian Martin","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52217394266_7172bf92d7_o.png","title":"The Russo Brothers Reveal Their Favorite Marvel Phase 4 Movie","tags":"movie news","excerpt":"The co-director of the blockbuster Avengers: Endgame, Joe Russo, reveals which of Marvel's Phase 4 films he thinks is “pitch-perfect.”"}]},"__N_SSG":true}
