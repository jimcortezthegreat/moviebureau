In more ways than one, the Oscars ceremony this year was a significant night for the elder Smith. Smith won Best Actor for his depiction of Richard Williams, father of tennis legends Venus and Serena, in the film King Richard, as expected. This was a significant victory for the actor, as it was his first ever win after receiving his third Academy Award nomination.</pre>","<pre class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>However, as many people are aware, winning an Oscar isn't the only reason his participation at the 2022 Oscars will be remembered. Earlier in the ceremony, comedian and presenter Chris Rock made a joke about Smith's wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, shaving her head and stating that she was ready to star in a sequel to 1997's G.I. Joe. Jane. Pinkett Smith, on the other hand, has been vocal about her difficulties with alopecia, a disorder that causes hair loss, for several years. Smith slapped Rock across the face when he approached the stage after plainly not taking kindly to the statement, then returned to his seat and admonished the comedian for ridiculing his wife.</pre>","<pre class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Smith's son Jaden recently tweeted his support for his father's behavior. While the message itself is a little confusing, it's hard to conceive the phrase could be referring to anything other than support for his father, who not only stood up for Jaden's mother, but also went on to win an Academy Award.</pre>","\n                <div class=\"ArticleBody_twitter__xokII\">\n                <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">And That’s How We Do It</p>— Jaden (@jaden) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jaden/status/1508295733551632389?ref_src=twsrc^tfw\">March 28, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n                </div>","<pre class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Both Smith's behavior and Jaden's post have elicited diverse reactions. Many people think that Rock's joke about Jada Pinkett Smith was utterly improper, with many viewers noting out that Rock made comments about her the last time he presented the Academy Awards. Others, however, have suggested that, while Smith had every right to be outraged, a public display of violence, especially at one of the year's most watched live television events, was not justified.</pre>","<pre class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>It's impossible to deny that Rock's joke was absolutely inappropriate, and it's obvious that Jaden supports his father. It's never okay to make a joke about someone's illness, especially when it's made in front of as many people as were watching the 2022 Academy Awards. Smith's Oscars slap, on the other hand, was inexcusable, and while he appears to have avoided legal action, many will doubt the producers' choice to keep him in the ceremony as if the incident never happened.</pre>"]},"reco":[{"id":"1d400a42-2c79-4fb8-be48-f5755e647e86","date":"Apr 4, 2022","author":"Nick Carver","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51981874143_be14c5c345_c.jpg","title":"6 Actors Who Have Played The Joker","tags":"movie news","excerpt":"From Cesar Romero in Batman '66 to Joaquin Phoenix, we examine what each of the cinematic Joker performers has given to the character."},{"id":"51ea00ed-a2df-4fcb-865e-4514d97e268d","date":"Apr 4, 2022","author":"Nick Carver","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51981798213_a2489e7dfc_c.jpg","title":"Why Heath Ledger's Joker from The Dark Knight is Still Scary Today","tags":"movie news","excerpt":"Heath Ledger's Joker still stands out among other comic villains, including Joaquin Phoenix and Jared Leto, thirteen years later."},{"id":"da2311fe-cb3b-49e1-9810-4f0dd8d5ac56","date":"Apr 4, 2022","author":"Nick Carver","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51981257166_cb88860fc2_c.jpg","title":"All Leonardo DiCaprio Movies You Can Watch on Netflix Right Now","tags":"movie news","excerpt":"Despite the fact that Leonardo DiCaprio has been one of the biggest movie stars for two decades and has grown up in front of audiences' eyes, there is still an unfathomable element to Leo."},{"id":"6e189b90-f62c-4134-966e-c905ca32ff22","date":"Apr 2, 2022","author":"Andres Pineda","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51975539757_43f130ff4e_o.png","title":"Lino Brocka Films That You Should Watch","tags":"movie news","excerpt":"Lino Brocka is a Filipino filmmaker who rose to prominence in the world film community with his documentaries about the dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos.
