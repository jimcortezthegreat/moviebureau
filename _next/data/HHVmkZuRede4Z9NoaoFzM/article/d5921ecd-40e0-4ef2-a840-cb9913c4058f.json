The show depicts harmless games turned deadly, turning childhood favorites like tug of war and even marbles into murderous activities, but Squid Game's most renowned game was its opening event. Red Light Green Light, one of the show's most dangerous games, required participants to halt moving when a terrifying, huge mechanical doll turned around. The doll has also become something of an unofficial Squid Game mascot, with a group of enthusiasts recently attempting to build the robot in real life.</pre>","\n                <div class='ArticleBody_related__oI_Nm'>\n                <p class='ArticleBody_relatedCap__07hkO'>RELATED:</p>\n                <a class='ArticleBody_relatedTitle__uyeq1' href='https://www.themoviebureau.com/article/7a18b13f-67ef-48a9-8715-35704015c3f8'>The Creator Of The Squid Game Reveals Plans To Bring Back</a>\n                </div>\n                ","<pre class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Showrunner Dong-hyuk has now revealed that he has more game ideas for Season 2, even if he isn't ready to release them just yet.</pre>","\n                <div class='ArticleBody_quote__9rdnr'>\n                <p>There will be more great games, that’s all I can say.

More Squid Game, on the other hand, appears to be a long way off, which isn't necessarily a bad thing because fans of the program will no doubt want Dong-hyuk to take his time bringing future seasons to life.</pre>","<pre class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>After the cliffhanger finish of Season 1, Squid Game could have easily moved away from more games and taken a whole other path. Despite receiving a warning from the game's leaders, the show's star and single survivor, Seong Gi-hun, set out to end the games once and for all. With Dong-hyuk already organizing his next round of lethal games, it appears that Seong will be involved in more terrifying Squid Game competitions in the future.</pre>"]},"reco":[{"id":"1d400a42-2c79-4fb8-be48-f5755e647e86","date":"Apr 4, 2022","author":"Nick Carver","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51981874143_be14c5c345_c.jpg","title":"6 Actors Who Have Played The Joker","tags":"movie news","excerpt":"From Cesar Romero in Batman '66 to Joaquin Phoenix, we examine what each of the cinematic Joker performers has given to the character."},{"id":"51ea00ed-a2df-4fcb-865e-4514d97e268d","date":"Apr 4, 2022","author":"Nick Carver","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51981798213_a2489e7dfc_c.jpg","title":"Why Heath Ledger's Joker from The Dark Knight is Still Scary Today","tags":"movie news","excerpt":"Heath Ledger's Joker still stands out among other comic villains, including Joaquin Phoenix and Jared Leto, thirteen years later."},{"id":"da2311fe-cb3b-49e1-9810-4f0dd8d5ac56","date":"Apr 4, 2022","author":"Nick Carver","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51981257166_cb88860fc2_c.jpg","title":"All Leonardo DiCaprio Movies You Can Watch on Netflix Right Now","tags":"movie news","excerpt":"Despite the fact that Leonardo DiCaprio has been one of the biggest movie stars for two decades and has grown up in front of audiences' eyes, there is still an unfathomable element to Leo."},{"id":"6e189b90-f62c-4134-966e-c905ca32ff22","date":"Apr 2, 2022","author":"Andres Pineda","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51975539757_43f130ff4e_o.png","title":"Lino Brocka Films That You Should Watch","tags":"movie news","excerpt":"Lino Brocka is a Filipino filmmaker who rose to prominence in the world film community with his documentaries about the dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos.
