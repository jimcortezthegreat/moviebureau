The actor plays the character for the majority of The Infinity Saga, culminating in Avengers: Endgame's final clash between his army and The Avengers. He can presently be found on Amazon Prime's Outer Range.</p>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <div>\n                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Thanos first appeared in the Marvel Cinematic Universe in a post-credits stinger for The Avengers in 2012, although Josh Brolin did not play him until 2014's Guardians of the Galaxy. He went on to become the franchise's principal bad guy, moving into the forefront with the release of Avengers: Infinity War in 2018, in which he used the Infinity Gauntlet to wipe off half of all living things. Thanos faced up against The Avengers for the final time a year later (and five years later in canon), only to be vanquished by an Infinity Gauntlet-wielding Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.). Thanos' transformation into dust essentially removed the Mad Titan from the canonical MCU chronology.</p>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <div>\n                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Thanos' narrative in the Marvel Cinematic Universe appears to have come to an end with the conclusion of The Infinity Saga. However, during a recent interview on SiriusXM's Jess Cagle Show, Brolin discussed a hypothetical comeback as The Mad Titan and stated that he would do it if Marvel asked him to.</p>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <div class='ArticleBody_quote__9rdnr'>\n                <p>I don't know where they're going with it, no.

Marvel has essentially moved on to the next major enemy in Phase 4, which appears to be building towards the formal debut of Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors) following his tease at the conclusion of Loki, as Brolin observed in his remarks. When you add in the fact that Brolin is engaged with other projects (like as the impending sequel to Dune), it appears that a Thanos comeback is still a long way off.</p>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <div class='ArticleBody_related__oI_Nm'>\n                <p class='ArticleBody_relatedCap__07hkO'>RELATED:</p>\n                <a class='ArticleBody_relatedTitle__uyeq1' href='https://www.themoviebureau.com/article/4b4d9d1e-d36f-4d42-a371-d5be789313a8'>The Director of Avengers: Endgame Explains Why Marvel Movies Have So Much Humor</a>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <div>\n                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>With all of this in mind, Thanos' return to the MCU appears to be becoming more likely. Phase 4 is going all-in on the multiverse notion, which means that depending on which world is visited next, a broad range of Thanos versions might appear. In the T'Challa-focused episode of What If..., that topic was already explored by giving Thanos a more heroic and appealing persona. Furthermore, because time travel is already a well-established idea in the MCU, characters may theoretically journey back in time to meet Thanos before Tony Stark gained the upper hand and defeated him.</p>\n                </div>\n                "]},"reco":[{"id":"d025cf6d-6367-4c10-ab6b-86af2aadca85","date":"May 12, 2022","author":"Brian Martin","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52067827583_cf2c8a5ff2_c.jpg","title":"The Director of Terminator: Salvation Reflects on the Film's Failure","tags":"movie news","excerpt":"Director McG believes he knows why the 2009 picture is frequently ranked at the bottom of Terminator rankings."},{"id":"a2b2cfd5-4af4-4f8f-ab7a-bdce2f968646","date":"May 10, 2022","author":"Brian Martin","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52062712242_6dc33f1ecb_c.jpg","title":"Ozark: Wendy Byrde Was The Show’s True Villain","tags":"movie news","excerpt":"Wendy Byrde (Laura Linney) is the most vicious and most cruel character in Ozark."},{"id":"784f4e1f-f33b-4b71-b35c-2a25da817385","date":"May 9, 2022","author":"Brian Martin","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52060947184_3996070d0a_c.jpg","title":"Directors Who Should Direct Marvel’s Fantastic Four Movie","tags":"movie news","excerpt":"Let the speculation about who will direct what may be the most crucial MCU entry begin now that Jon Watts has now swung out his role helming the upcoming Fantastic Four film."},{"id":"d1bbda9e-5edf-44ea-8481-384860b7e760","date":"May 9, 2022","author":"Brian Martin","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52060836094_87777217fa_o.png","title":"Tobey Maguire's Spider-Man Originally Had Mechanical Web-Shooters","tags":"movie news","excerpt":"Tobey Maguire's Spider-Man possessed the ability to create webs, but he came close to using mechanical web-shooters in his film debut."}]},"__N_SSG":true}
