The show depicts harmless games turned deadly, turning childhood favorites like tug of war and even marbles into murderous activities, but Squid Game's most renowned game was its opening event. Red Light Green Light, one of the show's most dangerous games, required participants to halt moving when a terrifying, huge mechanical doll turned around. The doll has also become something of an unofficial Squid Game mascot, with a group of enthusiasts recently attempting to build the robot in real life.</pre>","\n                <div class='ArticleBody_related__oI_Nm'>\n                <p class='ArticleBody_relatedCap__07hkO'>RELATED:</p>\n                <a class='ArticleBody_relatedTitle__uyeq1' href='https://www.themoviebureau.com/article/7a18b13f-67ef-48a9-8715-35704015c3f8'>The Creator Of The Squid Game Reveals Plans To Bring Back</a>\n                </div>\n                ","<pre class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Showrunner Dong-hyuk has now revealed that he has more game ideas for Season 2, even if he isn't ready to release them just yet.</pre>","\n                <div class='ArticleBody_quote__9rdnr'>\n                <p>There will be more great games, that’s all I can say.

More Squid Game, on the other hand, appears to be a long way off, which isn't necessarily a bad thing because fans of the program will no doubt want Dong-hyuk to take his time bringing future seasons to life.</pre>","<pre class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>After the cliffhanger finish of Season 1, Squid Game could have easily moved away from more games and taken a whole other path. Despite receiving a warning from the game's leaders, the show's star and single survivor, Seong Gi-hun, set out to end the games once and for all. With Dong-hyuk already organizing his next round of lethal games, it appears that Seong will be involved in more terrifying Squid Game competitions in the future.</pre>"]},"reco":[{"id":"4b4d9d1e-d36f-4d42-a371-d5be789313a8","date":"Apr 7, 2022","author":"Nick Carver","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51988471790_f1d8861371_c.jpg","title":"The Director of Avengers: Endgame Explains Why Marvel Movies Have So Much Humor","tags":"movie news","excerpt":"As Kevin Feige is aware of what people appreciate, Joe Russo explains that the secret to Marvel's success is the usage of comedy in their films."},{"id":"4485bf95-ab7a-4e8a-ae86-18d24b4bf297","date":"Apr 6, 2022","author":"Wallace Bell","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51986899144_f2db0f747f_c.jpg","title":"Time-Travel TV Shows That You Must Start Watching","tags":"tv news","excerpt":"Time travel is a popular subject in many forms of entertainment, from novels to movies.
