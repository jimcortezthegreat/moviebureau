The show follows 456 people who enter a competition in the hopes of winning a life-changing sum if they can survive the show's dangerous games. Squid Game's success was recently recognized at this year's award season, with the program winning three SAG awards and a Golden Globe, among other accolades.</p>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <div>\n                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>While the popularity of Squid Game can be attributed to outstanding storytelling and world-building, the game's major draw is its unusual and horrifying assortment of tournaments. The show depicts harmless games turned deadly, turning childhood favorites like tug of war and even marbles into murderous activities, but Squid Game's most renowned game was its opening event. Red Light Green Light, one of the show's most dangerous games, required participants to halt moving when a terrifying, huge mechanical doll turned around. The doll has also become something of an unofficial Squid Game mascot, with a group of enthusiasts recently attempting to build the robot in real life.</p>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <div class='ArticleBody_related__oI_Nm'>\n                <p class='ArticleBody_relatedCap__07hkO'>RELATED:</p>\n                <a class='ArticleBody_relatedTitle__uyeq1' href='https://www.themoviebureau.com/article/7a18b13f-67ef-48a9-8715-35704015c3f8'>The Creator Of The Squid Game Reveals Plans To Bring Back</a>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <div>\n                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Showrunner Dong-hyuk has now revealed that he has more game ideas for Season 2, even if he isn't ready to release them just yet.</p>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <div class='ArticleBody_quote__9rdnr'>\n                <p>There will be more great games, that’s all I can say.

Dong-hyuk has a plethora of possibilities to make Season 2 as successful as Season 1 with such a vibrant and innovative premise. More Squid Game, on the other hand, appears to be a long way off, which isn't necessarily a bad thing because fans of the program will no doubt want Dong-hyuk to take his time bringing future seasons to life.</p>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <div>\n                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>After the cliffhanger finish of Season 1, Squid Game could have easily moved away from more games and taken a whole other path. Despite receiving a warning from the game's leaders, the show's star and single survivor, Seong Gi-hun, set out to end the games once and for all. With Dong-hyuk already organizing his next round of lethal games, it appears that Seong will be involved in more terrifying Squid Game competitions in the future.</p>\n                </div>\n                "]},"reco":[{"id":"20f21369-01e5-4314-ba58-8357fd692e7a","date":"Aug 22, 2022","author":"Brian Martin","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52302597816_9d2b77723c_o.png","title":"The Heirs of the Dragon: House Of The Dragon Episode 1 Review","tags":"tv news","excerpt":"The first episode of the television series \"House of the Dragon\" features plenty of dragon blood."},{"id":"6006b928-df17-4339-83be-48c556f130b6","date":"Aug 17, 2022","author":"Brian Martin","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52291503484_5255d8337d_o.png","title":"Netflix And Chill With Park Seo-joon: Here Are All His Shows And Movies That You Can Watch On Netflix!","tags":"movie news","excerpt":"The romantic comedy king of Korea has arrived"},{"id":"784fda23-c9d9-41ee-b563-d84cd7ceb0b6","date":"Aug 15, 2022","author":"Brian Martin","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52287305098_e1a05b3c74_o.png","title":"Park Seo Jun discusses his involvement with the MCU, his relationships with BTS’s V and the rest of the “Wooga Squad,” and the social and economic themes that influenced his TV successes Itaewon Class","tags":"movie news","excerpt":"Park Seo Jun: ‘I actually couldn’t believe Marvel wanted to speak to me’"},{"id":"2d2a043a-6744-4343-b320-79dc5ca864c6","date":"Aug 12, 2022","author":"Brian Martin","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52280227358_0d847987e5_o.png","title":"Movie Review: Molly’s Game","tags":"movie news","excerpt":"Molly's Game, Aaron Sorkin's first film as a filmmaker, has a lot to chew on.
