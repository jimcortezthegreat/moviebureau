Tomei first appeared in the Marvel Cinematic Universe in Captain America: Civil War as the newest iteration of the beloved comic book character, who becomes Peter Parker's guardian when his parents die. Since then, Tomei has reprised her role as May in all of Tom Holland's Spider-Man films, including last year's highly anticipated No Way Home.</pre>","<pre class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>After a number of villains from Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield's Spider-Man universes, like as Alfred Molina's Doc Ock and Jamie Foxx's Electro, crossed over into the MCU timeline, Holland's Peter faced his hardest struggle yet. Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin, who killed Aunt May after an intense struggle with Parker, was the villain that caused the most pain and misery for Holland. The heartbreaking sequence included Tomei delivering a twist on the traditional Spider-Man line, \"With great power, comes great responsibility,\" and was a watershed moment in Holland's Spider-Man journey.</pre>","<pre class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Now, Tomei says she'd \"love to come back\" as Aunt May in the future. During a recent appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, Tomei admitted that she doesn't comprehend the multiverse and had to ask Spider-Man: No Way Home director Jon Watts to explain it to her numerous times. Tomei then goes on to talk about May's extensive history in the comics, as well as one of her former love interests, before affirming that, if the concept of the multiverse opens the door for her return in the future, she would be more than happy to do it.</pre>","\n                <div class='ArticleBody_quote__9rdnr'>\n                <p>Oh yes, there is a Multiverse. That’s true, that was part of the secrecy originally, now a lot of people know. But the thing was, if anyone asked me about it, I would have nothing - I don’t understand the Multiverse myself. Our wonderful director, Jon, and I’m like ‘And so, where am I now? Ok, well, can you explain it to me one more time?’ I would love to come back and be part of that. There’s history there, too. May Parker hooks up with Ant-Man - well, I mean, she’s a standalone character, of course, but there are more avenues to explore.</p>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <div class='ArticleBody_imageContainer__ktXae'>\n                <img src=\"https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/spider-man-no-way-home-aunt-may-1640100840.jpg?crop=0.806xw:1.00xh;0.157xw,0&resize=1200:*\" alt=\"marvel, sony, Spider-Man, mcu, aunt may\">\n                </div>","<pre class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Zendaya, Tomei's co-star in Spider-Man: No Way Home, recently stated that she believes Aunt May is underappreciated as a character and that she is a \"great role model\" for Peter. May is frequently depicted as a crucial component in Peter Parker's life in each Spider-Man incarnation, making her death all the more tragic given the depth of their relationship. Tomei also recently said that she told her therapist about No Way Home's finale before the film's premiere because she \"had to tell someone.”</pre>","<pre class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>May's death came as a shock to many viewers who had assumed her character's survival was a foregone conclusion due to her significant impact on Peter's life. Many fans are likely to agree with Tomei's sentiments and would love to see her return to the MCU in some capacity, though it's amusing to hear that if she does, she may not understand the logic behind her character's return. Given the MCU's Phase 4 multiverse plot, it's not out of the question that Tomei may return as an Aunt May variant who avoided the sad events of Spider-Man: No Way Home in the future.</pre>"]},"reco":[{"id":"78514777-2903-45c3-baff-d78b1abad317","date":"Mar 21, 2022","author":"Nick Carver","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51952783110_82df08fe6a_o.png","title":"Actor who played Gilgamesh in the Eternals is said to be returning for a new MCU film or show.","tags":"movie news","excerpt":"Don Lee, who played Gilgamesh in the Eternals, is rumored to be reprising his role as Gilgamesh in a secret MCU Phase 4 film or series set to begin production this summer."},{"id":"2e221ef6-4c78-468f-a2fc-868f6d1e6c5a","date":"Mar 21, 2022","author":"Nick Carver","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51952772020_5f22a80914_o.png","title":"Gilgamesh from The Eternals, Approves of His MCU Action Figure","tags":"movie news","excerpt":"Don Lee, who plays Gilgamesh in Marvel's The Eternals, is seen approving of Hot Toys' action figurines based on his role."},{"id":"7a18b13f-67ef-48a9-8715-35704015c3f8","date":"Mar 21, 2022","author":"Wallace Bell","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51952077484_727e913025_o.png","title":"The Creator Of The Squid Game Reveals Plans To Bring Back Actor in Season 2 After Character Death","tags":"tv news","excerpt":"Will there be a second season of Squid Game after it became the surprise Netflix success that blasted through streaming audiences in 2021?"},{"id":"d5921ecd-40e0-4ef2-a840-cb9913c4058f","date":"Mar 21, 2022","author":"Wallace Bell","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51950760392_6ddd24c1ba_o.png","title":"Season 2 Of Squid Game Will Have More Games, According To The Creator","tags":"tv news","excerpt":"Squid Game, Netflix's surprise blockbuster, has more lethal activities planned for its players in season 2, according to show creator Hwang Dong-hyuk."}]},"__N_SSG":true}
