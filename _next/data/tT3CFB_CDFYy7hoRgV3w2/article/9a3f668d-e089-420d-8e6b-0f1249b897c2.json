Soderbergh tackled a sports picture with High Flying Bird after experimenting with horror, stripper humor, and a slew of other genres. But this isn't the narrative you're expecting to hear. The uber-uber-dramatic life of a modern-day sports agent is chronicled in High Flying Bird.

Mike (Stern) and Jimmy (Dan Akroyd) are desperate for the Celtics to win the Jazz in Game 7 of the NBA Finals, so they intoxicate and abduct Utah's best player, Lewis Scott (Damon Wayans), which has far-reaching consequences.

Coach Pete Bell (played by Nick Nolte) is an old-school football coach who despises the unlawful \"booster activities\" that take on behind the scenes.
