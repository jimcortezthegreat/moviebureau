In more ways than one, the Oscars ceremony this year was a significant night for the elder Smith. Smith won Best Actor for his depiction of Richard Williams, father of tennis legends Venus and Serena, in the film King Richard, as expected. This was a significant victory for the actor, as it was his first ever win after receiving his third Academy Award nomination.</pre>","<pre class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>However, as many people are aware, winning an Oscar isn't the only reason his participation at the 2022 Oscars will be remembered. Earlier in the ceremony, comedian and presenter Chris Rock made a joke about Smith's wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, shaving her head and stating that she was ready to star in a sequel to 1997's G.I. Joe. Jane. Pinkett Smith, on the other hand, has been vocal about her difficulties with alopecia, a disorder that causes hair loss, for several years. Smith slapped Rock across the face when he approached the stage after plainly not taking kindly to the statement, then returned to his seat and admonished the comedian for ridiculing his wife.</pre>","<pre class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Smith's son Jaden recently tweeted his support for his father's behavior. While the message itself is a little confusing, it's hard to conceive the phrase could be referring to anything other than support for his father, who not only stood up for Jaden's mother, but also went on to win an Academy Award.</pre>","\n                <div class=\"ArticleBody_twitter__xokII\">\n                <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">And That’s How We Do It</p>— Jaden (@jaden) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jaden/status/1508295733551632389?ref_src=twsrc^tfw\">March 28, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n                </div>","<pre class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Both Smith's behavior and Jaden's post have elicited diverse reactions. Many people think that Rock's joke about Jada Pinkett Smith was utterly improper, with many viewers noting out that Rock made comments about her the last time he presented the Academy Awards. Others, however, have suggested that, while Smith had every right to be outraged, a public display of violence, especially at one of the year's most watched live television events, was not justified.</pre>","<pre class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>It's impossible to deny that Rock's joke was absolutely inappropriate, and it's obvious that Jaden supports his father. It's never okay to make a joke about someone's illness, especially when it's made in front of as many people as were watching the 2022 Academy Awards. Smith's Oscars slap, on the other hand, was inexcusable, and while he appears to have avoided legal action, many will doubt the producers' choice to keep him in the ceremony as if the incident never happened.</pre>"]},"reco":[{"id":"405cd1ef-56c8-494e-a132-c735b50d2f1c","date":"Apr 12, 2022","author":"Wallace Bell","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51999579280_96c97901cf_c.jpg","title":"Moon Knight Cannot Defeat The Mandalorian In A Fight, According To Pedro Pascal","tags":"tv news","excerpt":"Pedro Pascal joins the argument between Moon Knight and The Mandalorian, which was begun by Moon Knight star Oscar Isaac, and claims that his hero will triumph."},{"id":"062db741-dc24-4805-b849-f08c8a9941db","date":"Apr 11, 2022","author":"Nick Carver","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51997352443_38d85dc031_c.jpg","title":"The Reunion of Doc Ock and Maguire in Spider-Man Made Alfred Molina Cry","tags":"movie news","excerpt":"Alfred Molina, who featured with Tobey Maguire in Spider-Man 2, says that his reunion with Tobey Maguire, who he co-starred with in Spider-Man 2, made him weep."},{"id":"34e061d6-e747-4446-87b6-9e6618fbf51e","date":"Apr 11, 2022","author":"Andres Pineda","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51997523665_55c2a0f398_c.jpg","title":"The Best Filipino Movies That You Need To Watch","tags":"movie news","excerpt":"In this article, we look into Filipino films and cinema, which is undoubtedly one of Southeast Asia's most underrated businesses."},{"id":"6d8df57f-04ce-496f-b891-06c8208020ec","date":"Apr 11, 2022","author":"Wallace Bell","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51997038444_e1d6e422c3_c.jpg","title":"Season 4 Of Stranger Things Is Similar To Game Of Thrones, According To The Creators","tags":"tv news","excerpt":"While discussing Stranger Things season 4, the Duffer Brothers make a comparison between the Netflix series and Game of Thrones."}]},"__N_SSG":true}
