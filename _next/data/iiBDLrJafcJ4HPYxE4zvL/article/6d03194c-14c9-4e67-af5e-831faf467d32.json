Efron's career was launched with his portrayal as Troy Bolton in the famous Disney Channel original High School Musical. He's gone on to feature in big-budget comedies like Neighbors and Hugh Jackman's musical The Greatest Showman, as well as independent dramas like Lee Daniels' The Paperboy and Netflix's Ted Bundy picture Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil, and Vile.</p>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <div>\n                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Disney and Marvel Studios continue to hire top-tier talent, from Oscar Isaac and Florence Pugh to filmmakers like Chloé Zhao, as the MCU grows across all platforms (Eternals). Given the MCU's unmatched profit margins and certified-fresh track record on Rotten Tomatoes, just about everyone in Hollywood would at least contemplate joining its world. Efron has recently become a favorite fan cast for characters like as Nova, Adam Warlock, and the Human Torch, and it appears that he'd want to play a superhero/villain in the MCU.</p>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <div class='ArticleBody_imageContainer__ktXae'>\n                <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52048048182_1c9914dcd9_b.jpg\" alt=\"zac efron mcu, zac efron marvel, zac efron fantastic four, zac efron human torch\">\n                </div>","\n                <div>\n                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Efron discussed joining the MCU in a recent interview with Extra TV. When questioned about his fancasting, the former High School Musical actor was asked if he would ever consider portraying a superhero.</p>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <div class='ArticleBody_quote__9rdnr'>\n                <p>\"I love the Marvel universe.

It's no surprise that Efron, as one of the greatest actors on the globe who also happens to have a business connection with Disney, had a close call with a comic book part. Adam Warlock was cast by Marvel Studios for Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3. It was said that they were on the lookout for someone who met Efron's description, which led them to Will Poulter. To say the least, the studio already regards the Baywatch star as a clichéd superhero. It is only a matter of time before he plays one or portrays a villain that defies expectations.</p>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <div>\n                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Marvel Studios now owns Deadpool, the Fantastic Four, and the X-Men, thanks to Disney's acquisition of Fox in 2019. Mutants like Cyclops or even the hyper-muscular Wolverine might be the perfect fit for Efron when films like Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness expand the MCU's reach and flood its universe with even more people. In the meanwhile, Efron may be seen in the newest adaption of Stephen King's Firestarter on May 13 before appearing in a Disney+ version of Three Men and a Baby.</p>\n                </div>\n                "]},"reco":[{"id":"7f9dfde0-5d4a-43f6-a1c4-b0f626ef7dab","date":"May 15, 2022","author":"Brian Martin","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52074724140_d604f27001_o.png","title":"Christopher Walken Is The Excellent Choice for a God Emperor","tags":"movie news","excerpt":"In Dune: Part Two, Christopher Walken has been cast as Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV of House Corrino!"},{"id":"d025cf6d-6367-4c10-ab6b-86af2aadca85","date":"May 12, 2022","author":"Brian Martin","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52067827583_cf2c8a5ff2_c.jpg","title":"The Director of Terminator: Salvation Reflects on the Film's Failure","tags":"movie news","excerpt":"Director McG believes he knows why the 2009 picture is frequently ranked at the bottom of Terminator rankings."},{"id":"a2b2cfd5-4af4-4f8f-ab7a-bdce2f968646","date":"May 10, 2022","author":"Brian Martin","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52062712242_6dc33f1ecb_c.jpg","title":"Ozark: Wendy Byrde Was The Show’s True Villain","tags":"movie news","excerpt":"Wendy Byrde (Laura Linney) is the most vicious and most cruel character in Ozark."},{"id":"784f4e1f-f33b-4b71-b35c-2a25da817385","date":"May 9, 2022","author":"Brian Martin","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52060947184_3996070d0a_c.jpg","title":"Directors Who Should Direct Marvel’s Fantastic Four Movie","tags":"movie news","excerpt":"Let the speculation about who will direct what may be the most crucial MCU entry begin now that Jon Watts has now swung out his role helming the upcoming Fantastic Four film."}]},"__N_SSG":true}
