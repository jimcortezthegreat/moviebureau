It is one of the best-selling manga series of all time, with classics such as Eiichiro Oda's One Piece, Gosho Aoyama's Detective Conan, and Akira Toriyama's Dragon Ball, with over 250 million copies sold worldwide. Naruto, which aired from 2002 to 2007 and covered the first half of the plot, and Naruto: Shippuden, which aired from 2007 to 2017 and covered the post-time jump section of the story, were two anime series adapted from the manga by Studio Pierrot and Aniplex.
