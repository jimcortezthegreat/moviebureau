The MCU is the most profitable film series of all time, with $25.6 billion in worldwide box office receipts, and viewers have gotten engrossed in the characters and universe of these heroes over the last 14 years. The films have become quotable in regular conversation, and the discussion has become one of the most important pieces of shared cultural moments of the twenty-first century.</p>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <div>\n                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>The MCU's sense of humor began in 2008 with Iron Man, when the picture lacked a full script and had to rely on Robert Downey Jr.'s improv talents, which director Jon Favreau was well equipped for given his comedic background. The Avengers would further define the series, since the script's banter and humor was one of the film's highlights, and future MCU films have attempted to replicate it. The MCU's humorous components have now proven equally as popular with audiences as the action sequences.</p>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <div class='ArticleBody_imageContainer__ktXae'>\n                <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51987914126_6784ba6aa9_h.jpg\" alt=\"mcu, avengers, marvel\">\n                </div>","\n                <div>\n                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Russo explains why the MCU films have so much humour and claims that it is the secret to Marvel's success. Russo confirmed to Deadline through TheDirect that Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige enjoys testing Marvel films to see how fans react to them. Feige wants his audience to have a good time, and one way to do it is through humor.</p>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <div class='ArticleBody_quote__9rdnr'>\n                <p>\"Well, Marvel’s secret sauce is that Kevin likes the films to be entertaining, right? And entertaining typically involves humor, and I think that Kevin’s very big on testing movies and I think he likes to sit in the test screening and hear the response. So the audience’s laughing, you can hear their response. You can understand, ’Okay, every 2 minutes [they] are getting some enjoyment out of the movie,' and that’s a strong way for him to gauge how the movie will perform with an audience, right? So I think humor is very important to him.”</p>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <div>\n                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Some criticize the franchise's insistence on humor, believing it often deflates rather serious moments, and others criticize the franchise's inability to take anything seriously, such as mocking Doc Ock's name in Spider-Man: No Way Home. The MCU style of humor has become so popular that it has been imitated by other studios and has now gained a negative reception among some audience members as \"Marvel Humor.” Despite the humor, the MCU has been able to incorporate more lofty themes into their films, such as racial politics in Black Panther, colonialism's devastations and effects on refugees in both Captain Marvel and Thor: Ragnarok, and the complicated nature of children and parents in Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings.</p>\n                </div>\n                "]},"reco":[{"id":"119b2778-91fa-49b5-85ed-bb94dab1f369","date":"Apr 13, 2022","author":"Nick Carver","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52000704142_b5dbf6f77c_c.jpg","title":"Maisie Williams Reveals Whether She'd Consider Returning For A Game Of Thrones Spinoff","tags":"movie news","excerpt":"Maisie Williams, who played Arya Stark in the original series, discusses if she'd consider reprising her role in a potential Game of Thrones spinoff."},{"id":"d3f3a202-4f55-4b37-b4c7-18311b645ee7","date":"Apr 12, 2022","author":"Nick Carver","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52000225410_b129da30c7_c.jpg","title":"Karen Gillan Shares Her Funniest Avengers: Endgame Regret","tags":"movie news","excerpt":"Karen Gillan admits her one humorous Avengers: Endgame regret: she didn't take advantage of the opportunity to plug her other significant property."},{"id":"405cd1ef-56c8-494e-a132-c735b50d2f1c","date":"Apr 12, 2022","author":"Wallace Bell","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51999579280_96c97901cf_c.jpg","title":"Moon Knight Cannot Defeat The Mandalorian In A Fight, According To Pedro Pascal","tags":"tv news","excerpt":"Pedro Pascal joins the argument between Moon Knight and The Mandalorian, which was begun by Moon Knight star Oscar Isaac, and claims that his hero will triumph."},{"id":"062db741-dc24-4805-b849-f08c8a9941db","date":"Apr 11, 2022","author":"Nick Carver","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51997352443_38d85dc031_c.jpg","title":"The Reunion of Doc Ock and Maguire in Spider-Man Made Alfred Molina Cry","tags":"movie news","excerpt":"Alfred Molina, who featured with Tobey Maguire in Spider-Man 2, says that his reunion with Tobey Maguire, who he co-starred with in Spider-Man 2, made him weep."}]},"__N_SSG":true}
