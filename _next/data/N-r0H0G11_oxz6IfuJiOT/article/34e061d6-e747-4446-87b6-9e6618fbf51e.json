This great Filipino film is about an adult from the province who travels to Manila to rekindle his love for the first time in his life. However, when he tries to track down her likely whereabouts, he will discover that the city is far more chaotic than he imagined. Prostitution, poverty, capitalism, corruption, and colonialism are all issues that are slowly killing him. Its topics are still pertinent, and the difficulties in the Philippines are still distressing.</p>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <h2 class=\"ArticleBody_heading__tc5g4\">Himala</h2>\n                ","\n                <div class='ArticleBody_imageContainer__ktXae'>\n                <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51997043998_f7c07d7fa6_c.jpg\" alt=\"filipino movies, pinoy movies, tagalog movies\">\n                </div>","\n                <div>\n                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Himala stars Nora Aunor, Veronica Palileo, and Spanky Manikan and is set in a destitute Filipino town.

It's about a daughter who has a shady relationship with her mother's lover. Nonetheless, because of its powerful feministic viewpoint, Insiang is one of the most significant Filipino films ever created. Lino Brocka's status as one of the main voices in Philippine film is further established. Director Bong Joon-ho considers Brocka's work, as well as the work of other Asian directors, as an inspiration for his creative ideas in Parasite (2019).</p>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <h2 class=\"ArticleBody_heading__tc5g4\">Batch â€™81</h2>\n                ","\n                <div class='ArticleBody_imageContainer__ktXae'>\n                <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51997044073_6b5cc9b3f5_z.jpg\" alt=\"filipino movies, pinoy movies, tagalog movies\">\n                </div>","\n                <div>\n                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>In the Philippines, there was a time when filmmakers used their films to boldly oppose the authoritarian control of the government. Mike De Leon was a key figure during this time period. He also uses the authoritative/strongman rule of collegiate fraternities as the pattern for his anti-Martial Law preaching in his film Batch '81 (1982). The outcome is a candid story to a difficult subject, as well as a powerful statement about the impact of self-inflicted violence on everyone.</p>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <h2 class=\"ArticleBody_heading__tc5g4\">On The Job</h2>\n                ","\n                <div class='ArticleBody_imageContainer__ktXae'>\n                <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51996986251_ca25387556_z.jpg\" alt=\"filipino movies, pinoy movies, tagalog movies\">\n                </div>","\n                <div>\n                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Erik Matti's criminal drama On The Job premiered at Cannes in 2013 to excellent reviews. When the picture was finally released in Philippine theaters, it was as though a flash of optimism erupted in Philippine cinema. The film delves into the dark underbelly of politics and drug cartels, polished to resemble a David Fincher-directed Jason Bourne picture. Filipino action films are uncommon, and are frequently characterized by trite remarks and bizarre choreography. On The Job is a game-changer for contemporary Philippine film because of its intense action. So much so that a Hollywood adaptation was proposed at one time.</p>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <h2 class=\"ArticleBody_heading__tc5g4\">Ganito Kami Noon, Paano Kayo Ngayon</h2>\n                ","\n                <div class='ArticleBody_imageContainer__ktXae'>\n                <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51996986436_127250fe1d_b.jpg\" alt=\"filipino movies, pinoy movies, tagalog movies\">\n                </div>","\n                <div>\n                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>1976 was an exceptional year for Philippine cinema, with a number of legendary Filipino films being released month after month (Minsa'y Isang Gamu-Gamo, Nunal sa Tubig, Insiang). Ganito Kami Noon, Paano Kayo Ngayon by Eddie Romero was notable because its message endured for decades. It looks at nationalism as something that is defined not by where you live, but by your heart's pure intents. Christopher De Leon, the iconic Filipino actor, is at his best here, latching on to his character's path from naivete to ultimate loss of innocence as a result of foreign colonialism in the Philippines.</p>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <h2 class=\"ArticleBody_heading__tc5g4\">Tanging Yaman</h2>\n                ","\n                <div class='ArticleBody_imageContainer__ktXae'>\n                <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51997257699_427cc4268c_c.jpg\" alt=\"filipino movies, pinoy movies, tagalog movies\">\n                </div>","\n                <div>\n                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Carol Banawa sang a liturgical song by Manoling Francisco, SJ, that inspired the film's title.
