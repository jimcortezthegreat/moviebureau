The movies being moved include some huge ones like Fantastic Four and Avengers: Secret Wars, but the whole affair seemed to start with the studio's revival of Blade being blasted out of its November 2023 slot all the way to September 2024 because any MCU adjustments tend to have a domino effect.</p>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <div>\n                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>That was brought on by the director Bassim Tariq's resignation from the project less than two months before filming was supposed to begin, as well as rumors that the screenplay for the movie required a lot of work. Blade, which was initially introduced in July 2019 when star Mahershala Ali entered the stage with a headgear displaying the title of the film, is undoubtedly having some trouble at the moment.</p>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <div>\n                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>We'd want to present a dozen viable candidates for director as the first priority in order to right the ship and restart pre-production. Since we'd like to see the new Blade heavily rely on the MCU's rapidly growing horror wing—with Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness and Werewolf by Night leading the charge—this list should hopefully reflect a variety of both new and seasoned talent in that genre in addition to the usual amount of diversity.

The second and generally regarded as the greatest film in the original trilogy, Blade II (2002), directed by Del Toro, starred Wesley Snipes as the Daywalker. Del Toro would relish the opportunity to leave his stamp on the MCU with a character he can reinvent anyway he sees fit, even though he has moved on to other thematic themes with his more recent works like Nightmare Alley. Additionally, it may revive interest in a failing movie.</p>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <h2 class=\"ArticleBody_heading__tc5g4\">J.D.

Sleight, Dillard's 2016 feature film debut, starred a superb Jacob Latimore as a youthful street magician who also transforms himself into a handmade superhero. Dillard then published Sweetheart, a terrifying story about Kiersey Clemons becoming stuck on an island with a human-like sea monster. His upcoming movie, Devotion, is a war drama, but his recent work, such directing episodes of The Twilight Zone and The Outsider, shows that he has a strong affinity for the occult, which would make him a suitable candidate for Blade.</p>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <h2 class=\"ArticleBody_heading__tc5g4\">Nia DaCosta</h2>\n                ","\n                <div class='ArticleBody_imageContainer__ktXae'>\n                <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52434788364_8e4c586715_b.jpg\" alt=\"Blade reboot director Mahershala Ali\">\n                </div>","\n                <div>\n                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>DaCosta made Marvel history when she was hired as the studio's first Black female director and youngest director.
