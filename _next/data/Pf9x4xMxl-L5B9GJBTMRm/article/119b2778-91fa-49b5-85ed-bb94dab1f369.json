Despite her stubborn spirit, which she shared with the other Stark siblings, she was trained as a Faceless One, which she subsequently used to wreak devastation on her family's adversaries. She became one of the show's most accomplished heroines in Season 8, as she was the one who eventually killed the Night King and defeated the White Walker danger.</p>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <div>\n                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Williams is now being questioned in a GQ piece if she would consider repeating her part in a future Game of Thrones spinoff project. While she doesn't rule it out completely, she makes it clear that her response is in no way a confirmation, and that no such return is presently in the works. Williams, on the other hand, would be open to an Arya comeback provided it made sense for both her career and the Game of Thrones world.</p>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <div class='ArticleBody_quote__9rdnr'>\n                <p>I’m not saying it would never happen, but I’m also not saying it in this interview so that everyone goes… [gasps] 'The spin-off!

The new series has the advantage of being set a few centuries before the events of its parent program, which means it doesn't have any of the show's narrative baggage and has a genuine chance of recapturing the enchantment that enchanted so many people around the world. Game of Thrones season 8's failure may even work in its advantage, reducing expectations to the point where any amount of success would be welcomed by returning viewers.</p>\n                </div>\n                "]},"reco":[{"id":"554a196c-b8fb-4e35-996c-c4cf278880c4","date":"Oct 17, 2022","author":"Brian Martin","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52434788479_04e82a9daa_o.png","title":"Movie Directors Who Could Direct Marvel Studios’ Blade Reboot","tags":"movie news","excerpt":"We have a few ideas for the next Blade MCU adaptation's director, which Marvel needs."},{"id":"b09096a6-98ee-4d01-9efb-174cf2d788b4","date":"Oct 3, 2022","author":"Brian Martin","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52401112067_bb1a1c6efc_o.png","title":"Why the King Kong speech from Training Day is one of the greatest movie monologues ever","tags":"movie news","excerpt":"In Training Day's King Kong announcement, Denzel Washington improvised the key sentence, but it was crucial."},{"id":"5fd80d5c-3cf0-4561-9756-1b3dcde0256e","date":"Sep 18, 2022","author":"Brian Martin","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52365853308_682f751031_o.png","title":"List of Best Evan Peters Movies and Tv Shows That You Should Watch","tags":"movie news","excerpt":"Over the course of his acting career, Evan Peters has portrayed a wide range of roles.
