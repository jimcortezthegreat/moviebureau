In Chloé Zhao's 2022 Marvel epic, the actor played the immortal hero. Gemma Chan, Richard Madden, Angelina Jolie, Barry Keoghan, Lauren Ridloff, Kumail Nanjiani, Bryan Tyree Henry, Lia McHugh, and Salma Hayek co-starred with Lee in the film.</pre>","<pre class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Lee's Gilgamesh is the most powerful of the Eternals and the most powerful of the Celestial-created defenders of the Earth, able to employ his energy manipulation powers to create a powerful exoskeleton that he uses to fight the Deviants. When Thena (Jolie) develops Mahd Wy'ry and inadvertently assaults her fellow Eternals, Gilgamesh exiles her so that her condition does not endanger the team and he can care for her in a more secure environment. While Gilgamesh's function changed from previous drafts, his and Thena's friendship became one of the Eternals' most well-known features, making them likeable characters. Many fans, including Lee himself, were ecstatic to see the character depicted on products, as he disclosed in a recent post.</pre>","\n                <div class='ArticleBody_related__oI_Nm'>\n                <p class='ArticleBody_relatedCap__07hkO'>RELATED:</p>\n                <a class='ArticleBody_relatedTitle__uyeq1' href='https://www.themoviebureau.com/article/78514777-2903-45c3-baff-d78b1abad317'>Actor who played Gilgamesh in the Eternals is said to be returning for a new MCU film or show</a>\n                </div>\n                ","<pre class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Lee was spotted reacting to two recently released pieces of Eternals memorabilia starring Gilgamesh, as shared by the Eternals Update Twitter fan account. Lee may be seen holding two Hot Toys pieces in the images. He has a Cosbaby Gilgamesh figure inspired by chibi art, as well as a high-end Hot Toys Sixth Scale figure Gilgamesh, who will join the already announced Thena Sixth Scale figure as the second character in the Eternals series. Lee is smiling in the photo, holding each of the two things and giving them a thumbs up in appreciation.</pre>","\n                <div class='ArticleBody_imageContainer__ktXae'>\n                <img src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FOAsvkFXEAMuT2u?format=jpg&name=900x900\" alt=\"marvel, mcu, eternals, gilgamesh\">\n                </div>","<pre class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Hasbro has previously created figures based on the Eternals, as well as their Deviant nemesis Kro (Bill Skarsgard), in their Marvel Legends series of 6-inch action figures. However, unlike Lee, one of his co-stars, Salma Hayek, has spoken out about troubles she's had with her Marvel Legends Ajak action figure. Hayek said her action figure's look was \"scary\" on a televised appearance with Nanjiani to promote the film, after which she jokingly duplicated the figure's image. The figure, according to Nanjiani, had a \"E.T head.”</pre>","<pre class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>While Gilgamesh sacrificed himself to stop Kro in Eternals, the character's concern for Thena and Lee's performance struck a chord with viewers. As a result, many fans are looking forward to items featuring his character. Hot Toys is well-known for making high-quality figures of Marvel heroes, which have a long history of being highly detailed and accurate. Collectors may be able to look forward to future products depicting the Eternals' toughest combatant, with Lee speculated to return for a future MCU project.</pre>"]},"reco":[{"id":"71995c14-eccf-4eb4-8fee-7425409a94c0","date":"Mar 23, 2022","author":"Kohei Watanabe","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51956013878_29e059cdb5_c.jpg","title":"Barcelona Footballer Pays Tribute To Goku From Dragon Ball Z","tags":"anime news","excerpt":"During a match against Real Madrid, FC Barcelona footballer Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang shows off his Dragon Ball fandom."},{"id":"c8d944af-1b0d-4791-9664-7109dd706711","date":"Mar 23, 2022","author":"Nick Carver","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51956197919_10291798e9_o.png","title":"'Drive My Car,' an Oscar-nominated film by Ryusuke Hamaguchi, has been added to the Criterion Collection","tags":"movie news","excerpt":"'Drive My Car' is the first Japanese film to receive an Oscar nomination for Best Picture."},{"id":"77b6029d-1393-4cd6-8d6e-42f72b361c09","date":"Mar 23, 2022","author":"Wallace Bell","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51955747851_c256e4d768_o.png","title":"The Best Zombie TV Shows That You Should Start Watching","tags":"tv news","excerpt":"There are many TV shows featuring zombies, ranging from dramas to post-apocalyptic thrillers and even comedies, but these are the best ones you should start watching."},{"id":"71d9aa6e-276f-4f36-b1b8-79f1ded363d6","date":"Mar 22, 2022","author":"Nick Carver","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51953436092_93676042cf_o.png","title":"Director Says Morbius Has Endless Marvel Crossover Possibilities.","tags":"movie news","excerpt":"Exclusive: Director Daniel Espinosa discusses potential future Marvel crossovers as Morbius becomes the latest film in Sony's Spider-Man Universe."}]},"__N_SSG":true}
