The show depicts harmless games turned deadly, turning childhood favorites like tug of war and even marbles into murderous activities, but Squid Game's most renowned game was its opening event. Red Light Green Light, one of the show's most dangerous games, required participants to halt moving when a terrifying, huge mechanical doll turned around. The doll has also become something of an unofficial Squid Game mascot, with a group of enthusiasts recently attempting to build the robot in real life.</pre>","\n                <div class='ArticleBody_related__oI_Nm'>\n                <p class='ArticleBody_relatedCap__07hkO'>RELATED:</p>\n                <a class='ArticleBody_relatedTitle__uyeq1' href='https://www.themoviebureau.com/article/7a18b13f-67ef-48a9-8715-35704015c3f8'>The Creator Of The Squid Game Reveals Plans To Bring Back</a>\n                </div>\n                ","<pre class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Showrunner Dong-hyuk has now revealed that he has more game ideas for Season 2, even if he isn't ready to release them just yet.</pre>","\n                <div class='ArticleBody_quote__9rdnr'>\n                <p>There will be more great games, that’s all I can say.

More Squid Game, on the other hand, appears to be a long way off, which isn't necessarily a bad thing because fans of the program will no doubt want Dong-hyuk to take his time bringing future seasons to life.</pre>","<pre class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>After the cliffhanger finish of Season 1, Squid Game could have easily moved away from more games and taken a whole other path. Despite receiving a warning from the game's leaders, the show's star and single survivor, Seong Gi-hun, set out to end the games once and for all. With Dong-hyuk already organizing his next round of lethal games, it appears that Seong will be involved in more terrifying Squid Game competitions in the future.</pre>"]},"reco":[{"id":"71995c14-eccf-4eb4-8fee-7425409a94c0","date":"Mar 23, 2022","author":"Kohei Watanabe","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51956013878_29e059cdb5_c.jpg","title":"Barcelona Footballer Pays Tribute To Goku From Dragon Ball Z","tags":"anime news","excerpt":"During a match against Real Madrid, FC Barcelona footballer Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang shows off his Dragon Ball fandom."},{"id":"c8d944af-1b0d-4791-9664-7109dd706711","date":"Mar 23, 2022","author":"Nick Carver","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51956197919_10291798e9_o.png","title":"'Drive My Car,' an Oscar-nominated film by Ryusuke Hamaguchi, has been added to the Criterion Collection","tags":"movie news","excerpt":"'Drive My Car' is the first Japanese film to receive an Oscar nomination for Best Picture."},{"id":"77b6029d-1393-4cd6-8d6e-42f72b361c09","date":"Mar 23, 2022","author":"Wallace Bell","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51955747851_c256e4d768_o.png","title":"The Best Zombie TV Shows That You Should Start Watching","tags":"tv news","excerpt":"There are many TV shows featuring zombies, ranging from dramas to post-apocalyptic thrillers and even comedies, but these are the best ones you should start watching."},{"id":"71d9aa6e-276f-4f36-b1b8-79f1ded363d6","date":"Mar 22, 2022","author":"Nick Carver","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51953436092_93676042cf_o.png","title":"Director Says Morbius Has Endless Marvel Crossover Possibilities.","tags":"movie news","excerpt":"Exclusive: Director Daniel Espinosa discusses potential future Marvel crossovers as Morbius becomes the latest film in Sony's Spider-Man Universe."}]},"__N_SSG":true}
