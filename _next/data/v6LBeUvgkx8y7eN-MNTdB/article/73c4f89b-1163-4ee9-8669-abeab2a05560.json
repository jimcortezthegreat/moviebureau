However, out of all the Disney+ series so far, it turned out to be one of the most inventive and emotionally gripping storylines. It turns out that the program's creator and writer, Michael Waldron, was likewise a little unsure about how the show would function at first. While promoting his current effort, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, Waldron spoke with The Playlist about how the series came to be and what affected their approach.</p>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <div class='ArticleBody_quote__9rdnr'>\n                <p>“I remember I pulled off into a parking garage in Burbank, so Kevin Wright, our producer, could call me. And this is in November before Endgame came out. So he could call me and tell me what happened in Endgame, so I could know. Because I was like, 'How is Loki alive in the show?' How was there even a show? And so he called me, and he was like, 'So, Endgame is a time heist.' And I was like, 'Oh my God.' And it’s perfect.”</p>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <div class='ArticleBody_imageContainer__ktXae'>\n                <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52025733611_a7316cfaa7_b.jpg\" alt=\"marvel, mcu, avengers endgame loki, loki variants\">\n                </div>","\n                <div>\n                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>\"I'm in a parking garage,\" Waldron said, jokingly. 'Somebody's going to shoot me,' I thought. So they had the idea that Loki was going to escape with the Infinity Stone and land at the TVA and run afoul of the TVA. But that was really it.\" With the fundamentals in hand, Waldron discovered he had a lot of room to work with when creating Loki.</p>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <div class='ArticleBody_quote__9rdnr'>\n                <p>“What that meant, what kind of adventure he went on, even what the TVA was, as an entity within the MCU and how we would adapt that from the comics, were all up for grabs.

Because I knew Kang was coming down the pipe as a villain in the MCU and it just felt too delicious to not have him intertwined in our time travel story somehow.”</p>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <div>\n                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>It's fascinating to see how the events of Endgame set the way for Loki, and how the multiverse has essentially superseded the concept of time travel in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Marvel is known for being ten steps ahead of the competition, and knowing how early Kang was considered for the role of MCU's new big evil should pique any fan's interest in the franchise's future. Endgame and Loki may seem like a long time ago, but it's always wonderful to be reminded that their ramifications can still be felt in the MCU today. The universe is virtually destroyed as a result of the events in Spider-Man: No Way Home, causing complications for characters like Doctor Strange.</p>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <div>\n                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>It's amazing to hear Waldron's firsthand account of working on some of Phase 4's best (and most anticipated) Marvel material. The multiverse boat would have sunk by now if it hadn't been for writers like Waldron.</p>\n                </div>\n                "]},"reco":[{"id":"6006b928-df17-4339-83be-48c556f130b6","date":"Aug 17, 2022","author":"Brian Martin","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52291503484_5255d8337d_o.png","title":"Netflix And Chill With Park Seo-joon: Here Are All His Shows And Movies That You Can Watch On Netflix!","tags":"movie news","excerpt":"The romantic comedy king of Korea has arrived"},{"id":"784fda23-c9d9-41ee-b563-d84cd7ceb0b6","date":"Aug 15, 2022","author":"Brian Martin","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52287305098_e1a05b3c74_o.png","title":"Park Seo Jun discusses his involvement with the MCU, his relationships with BTS’s V and the rest of the “Wooga Squad,” and the social and economic themes that influenced his TV successes Itaewon Class","tags":"movie news","excerpt":"Park Seo Jun: ‘I actually couldn’t believe Marvel wanted to speak to me’"},{"id":"2d2a043a-6744-4343-b320-79dc5ca864c6","date":"Aug 12, 2022","author":"Brian Martin","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52280227358_0d847987e5_o.png","title":"Movie Review: Molly’s Game","tags":"movie news","excerpt":"Molly's Game, Aaron Sorkin's first film as a filmmaker, has a lot to chew on.
