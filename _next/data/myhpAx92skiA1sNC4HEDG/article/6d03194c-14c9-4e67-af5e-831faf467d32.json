Efron's career was launched with his portrayal as Troy Bolton in the famous Disney Channel original High School Musical. He's gone on to feature in big-budget comedies like Neighbors and Hugh Jackman's musical The Greatest Showman, as well as independent dramas like Lee Daniels' The Paperboy and Netflix's Ted Bundy picture Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil, and Vile.</p>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <div>\n                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Disney and Marvel Studios continue to hire top-tier talent, from Oscar Isaac and Florence Pugh to filmmakers like Chloé Zhao, as the MCU grows across all platforms (Eternals). Given the MCU's unmatched profit margins and certified-fresh track record on Rotten Tomatoes, just about everyone in Hollywood would at least contemplate joining its world. Efron has recently become a favorite fan cast for characters like as Nova, Adam Warlock, and the Human Torch, and it appears that he'd want to play a superhero/villain in the MCU.</p>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <div class='ArticleBody_imageContainer__ktXae'>\n                <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52048048182_1c9914dcd9_b.jpg\" alt=\"zac efron mcu, zac efron marvel, zac efron fantastic four, zac efron human torch\">\n                </div>","\n                <div>\n                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Efron discussed joining the MCU in a recent interview with Extra TV. When questioned about his fancasting, the former High School Musical actor was asked if he would ever consider portraying a superhero.</p>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <div class='ArticleBody_quote__9rdnr'>\n                <p>\"I love the Marvel universe.

It's no surprise that Efron, as one of the greatest actors on the globe who also happens to have a business connection with Disney, had a close call with a comic book part. Adam Warlock was cast by Marvel Studios for Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3. It was said that they were on the lookout for someone who met Efron's description, which led them to Will Poulter. To say the least, the studio already regards the Baywatch star as a clichéd superhero. It is only a matter of time before he plays one or portrays a villain that defies expectations.</p>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <div>\n                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Marvel Studios now owns Deadpool, the Fantastic Four, and the X-Men, thanks to Disney's acquisition of Fox in 2019. Mutants like Cyclops or even the hyper-muscular Wolverine might be the perfect fit for Efron when films like Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness expand the MCU's reach and flood its universe with even more people. In the meanwhile, Efron may be seen in the newest adaption of Stephen King's Firestarter on May 13 before appearing in a Disney+ version of Three Men and a Baby.</p>\n                </div>\n                "]},"reco":[{"id":"f604210e-6a8c-4508-9669-4745d39bf7c0","date":"Jul 13, 2022","author":"Brian Martin","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52212039877_a813967c89_o.png","title":"How the Marvel Cinematic Universe was influenced by The Dark Knight","tags":"movie news","excerpt":"Although The Dark Knight is often regarded as the pinnacle of superhero movies, did it really have an influence on the more well-known Marvel Cinematic Universe?"},{"id":"52fb1f69-c802-4d2b-b1ef-6d650023ddd4","date":"Jul 12, 2022","author":"Brian Martin","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52211207270_90e58bd2f3_o.png","title":"Moon Knight Season 2: What To Expect","tags":"tv news","excerpt":"Although the MCU series' second season has not yet been announced, creator Jeremy Slater has ambitious intentions if Moon Knight is given a second chance."},{"id":"dffa1745-2c6b-42a3-91a3-b07d7eb3e00e","date":"Jul 11, 2022","author":"Brian Martin","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52208264963_d3ca84afcb_o.png","title":"Ranking The Craziest Nicolas Cage Performances Ever","tags":"movie news","excerpt":"These performances by Nicolas Cage provide as evidence that he is a unique performer"},{"id":"e238699d-70f7-40a4-a096-a586eb6fd1e7","date":"Jul 8, 2022","author":"Brian Martin","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52201616346_be60795aaf_o.png","title":"Stranger Things: The Real-Life Inspiration Behind Eddie Munson","tags":"tv news","excerpt":"Season 4 of Stranger Things' inaccurate charge of Eddie Munson was based on a true story of Satanic fear."}]},"__N_SSG":true}
