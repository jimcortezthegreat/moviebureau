The first Pirates of the Caribbean film, released in 2003, was a huge smash with audiences and launched a multi-billion-dollar franchise. Captain Jack Sparrow, played by Johnny Depp, was introduced to viewers in Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, a beloved figure who would go on to feature in all four sequels, the most recent of which, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales, was released in 2017.</p>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <div>\n                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>The possibility of a sixth Pirates of the Caribbean film has been discussed since before the fifth, but no new information has been released about the project in a long time. The production of a sixth Pirates of the Caribbean film might possibly be hampered by Depp's current legal issues. The 58-year-old actor's troubled marriage with ex-wife Amber Heard has long been the topic of tabloid headlines, and the two stars' bitter spat has now moved to the courtroom, with Depp suing Heard for $50 million in defamation.</p>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <div>\n                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Depp's evidence in court against Heard included an unexpected admission: he'd never seen Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, according to Matthew Belloni, creator of Puck News. Belloni considers Depp's admission \"a baller move,\" noting that he was nominated for Best Actor at the 2004 Academy Awards for his performance as Sparrow.</p>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <div class=\"ArticleBody_twitter__xokII\">\n                <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Johnny Depp just said in court he never saw the first PIRATES movie.

Depp, who has previously stated that he does not enjoy viewing his own films, joins the ranks of Meryl Streep, Joaquin Phoenix, Javier Bardem, and Reese Witherspoon as performers who skip their own films. While it may seem strange that Depp didn't see a film for which he was nominated for an Academy Award, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl appears to be only the latest in a long series of Depp films that he hasn't seen.</p>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <div>\n                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>It's unclear how Depp's current legal issues will affect the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise's future. Even said, it's becoming increasingly improbable that Depp would reprise his role as Captain Jack Sparrow. The Pirates of the Caribbean series may have to learn to thrive without Depp's presence, with a spinoff reportedly in production with Margot Robbie attached to feature. Many fans believe the latter episodes are notably worse than Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl and the other two original trilogy films, therefore it could be a good thing for the franchise to receive a fresh start.</p>\n                </div>\n                "]},"reco":[{"id":"f604210e-6a8c-4508-9669-4745d39bf7c0","date":"Jul 13, 2022","author":"Brian Martin","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52212039877_a813967c89_o.png","title":"How the Marvel Cinematic Universe was influenced by The Dark Knight","tags":"movie news","excerpt":"Although The Dark Knight is often regarded as the pinnacle of superhero movies, did it really have an influence on the more well-known Marvel Cinematic Universe?"},{"id":"52fb1f69-c802-4d2b-b1ef-6d650023ddd4","date":"Jul 12, 2022","author":"Brian Martin","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52211207270_90e58bd2f3_o.png","title":"Moon Knight Season 2: What To Expect","tags":"tv news","excerpt":"Although the MCU series' second season has not yet been announced, creator Jeremy Slater has ambitious intentions if Moon Knight is given a second chance."},{"id":"dffa1745-2c6b-42a3-91a3-b07d7eb3e00e","date":"Jul 11, 2022","author":"Brian Martin","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52208264963_d3ca84afcb_o.png","title":"Ranking The Craziest Nicolas Cage Performances Ever","tags":"movie news","excerpt":"These performances by Nicolas Cage provide as evidence that he is a unique performer"},{"id":"e238699d-70f7-40a4-a096-a586eb6fd1e7","date":"Jul 8, 2022","author":"Brian Martin","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52201616346_be60795aaf_o.png","title":"Stranger Things: The Real-Life Inspiration Behind Eddie Munson","tags":"tv news","excerpt":"Season 4 of Stranger Things' inaccurate charge of Eddie Munson was based on a true story of Satanic fear."}]},"__N_SSG":true}
