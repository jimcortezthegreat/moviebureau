Despite her stubborn spirit, which she shared with the other Stark siblings, she was trained as a Faceless One, which she subsequently used to wreak devastation on her family's adversaries. She became one of the show's most accomplished heroines in Season 8, as she was the one who eventually killed the Night King and defeated the White Walker danger.</p>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <div>\n                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Williams is now being questioned in a GQ piece if she would consider repeating her part in a future Game of Thrones spinoff project. While she doesn't rule it out completely, she makes it clear that her response is in no way a confirmation, and that no such return is presently in the works. Williams, on the other hand, would be open to an Arya comeback provided it made sense for both her career and the Game of Thrones world.</p>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <div class='ArticleBody_quote__9rdnr'>\n                <p>I’m not saying it would never happen, but I’m also not saying it in this interview so that everyone goes… [gasps] 'The spin-off!

The new series has the advantage of being set a few centuries before the events of its parent program, which means it doesn't have any of the show's narrative baggage and has a genuine chance of recapturing the enchantment that enchanted so many people around the world. Game of Thrones season 8's failure may even work in its advantage, reducing expectations to the point where any amount of success would be welcomed by returning viewers.</p>\n                </div>\n                "]},"reco":[{"id":"e238699d-70f7-40a4-a096-a586eb6fd1e7","date":"Jul 8, 2022","author":"Brian Martin","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52201616346_be60795aaf_o.png","title":"Stranger Things: The Real-Life Inspiration Behind Eddie Munson","tags":"tv news","excerpt":"Season 4 of Stranger Things' inaccurate charge of Eddie Munson was based on a true story of Satanic fear."},{"id":"4d162734-0f96-436b-9146-ef54a7a695bb","date":"Jun 28, 2022","author":"Brian Martin","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52181564543_9faa1d67f9_o.png","title":"What has Marvel planned for MCU Phase 5?","tags":"movie news","excerpt":"We'll soon learn about Marvel's plans for Phase 5 of the MCU, but do we already know where things are going?"},{"id":"9aeaa841-f8d6-416f-b890-edd687d3e53a","date":"Jun 15, 2022","author":"Brian Martin","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52147119867_4eaed72801_c.jpg","title":"Why Is The Wire Still Relevant After 14 Years?","tags":"tv news","excerpt":"The Wire is still one of the most important and recognized television series of all time, twenty years later."},{"id":"00ea2af1-4379-4d41-b68a-1e3176e5be09","date":"Jun 4, 2022","author":"Brian Martin","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52121439835_8627ef6098_o.png","title":"How Community Prepared The Russo Brothers for Marvel","tags":"movie news","excerpt":"The Russo Brothers talk about how their work on the cult sitcom Community prepared them for blockbusters like Marvel's Avengers: Endgame."}]},"__N_SSG":true}
