However, Park is well-known in South Korea as a result of a number of popular local TV shows, notably romantic comedies like She Was Pretty and Fight for My Way, as well as the Netflix sensation Itaewon Class. As the third South Korean actor to join the MCU, he will now have a greater worldwide reputation thanks to the news that he would be acting in Captain Marvel 2: The Marvels alongside Brie Larson, Iman Vellani, and Zawe Ashton.</p>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <div>\n                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>“When I first heard that the Marvel Cinematic Universe wanted to speak with me, I couldn’t believe it. I actually couldn’t believe it,” says Park. Regarding the specifics, he chooses to keep silent. He smiles, seeming a little frazzled, “I’m just trying to be careful with Marvel-related questions.”\nBeing pledged to secrecy by the MCU stars is not surprising. “I’m not someone who has a fear of challenges, but whether I am filming in South Korea or abroad, everything is a challenge for me. So, I did feel some nerves at first. But everyone was so helpful and welcoming that I was able to find my feet really quickly.”</p>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <div>\n                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Park is in Seoul on the day we chat, having recently returned from filming in London.

During my early days of acting, it was very difficult for me. In your 20s you have to work really hard but also be careful with everything. Life, love, career, passion – everything. Fight for My Way was one of the best dramas that could possibly portray these feelings. I could connect with Dong-man. At times, he failed and got frustrated with himself but he endured and showed up for himself.
