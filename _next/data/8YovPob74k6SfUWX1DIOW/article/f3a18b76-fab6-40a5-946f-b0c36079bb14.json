On The Hateful Eight, the filmmaker collaborated with Ennio Morricone, the composer of The Thing, even using some cues from the horror classic in the cold Western. The Thing, on the other hand, appears to have influenced Tarantino's earlier film Reservoir Dogs. And it's all because Tarantino's terrified reaction to Carpenter's masterwork is one of the few.</p>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <div>\n                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Tarantino claims to be a \"big horror movie fan\" who doesn't get terrified easily. \"I respond to suspense, I respond to that – oh what’s gonna happen next, and I can jump by a ‘boo’ scare – but that’s not really terror.\" Tarantino says. The Thing, on the other hand, terrified Tarantino. That's why the filmmaker wanted to \"bring it under the microscope\" and figure out what makes Carpenter's picture so terrifying.</p>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <div class='ArticleBody_imageContainer__ktXae'>\n                <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52086174314_400917bbb6_o.jpg\" alt=\"Quentin Tarantino Reservoir Dogs\">\n                </div>","\n                <div class='ArticleBody_quote__9rdnr'>\n                <p>“I think the reason [for it being scary] is this. These men are trapped in this situation in this arctic research center, and one or more of them are possibly this Thing that’s going to devour all of them. And no one knows if you are the guy I’ve known forever or you are a Thing. And the movie makes the paranoia of that so palpable, so real, it’s almost like another character in the movie. The sheer paranoia of it. They’re trapped in the Antarctic, in this shelter, and so the paranoia is bouncing off of the four walls… until it has nowhere to go except through the fourth wall into the audience.

It might be Kill Bill 3 or something a little more outlandish, like a spaghetti western comedy.
