He rose to prominence as the face of the Guardians series and was charged with completing the trilogy's final chapter, but his plans were thwarted when Disney notoriously dismissed him over previous tweets. When James Gunn returned for Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, he was greeted with open arms and he became significantly involved in the MCU's Phase 4 preparations once more.</p>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <div>\n                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>The filmmaker has been filming Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 for several months ahead of its May 2023 release date, but it's simply one of four projects in which he's a little part. Since the Guardians of the Galaxy gang will appear in Thor: Love and Thunder before the threequel, Gunn has stated that he has counseled on the film. He is also in charge of directing Disney+'s Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special. Gunn is also a part of the Disney+ animated series I Am Groot. It's logical to ask what the MCU's future holds for him, given the popularity of these characters and the critical accolades his MCU productions have earned.</p>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <div>\n                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Although Gunn's time with the MCU is certainly far from over, the issue of what else he could do after the Guardians of the Galaxy films lingers. Because Gunn is so active on social media, he's now spoken out on his future with the MCU. It all started when the filmmaker responded to a fan's question on Twitter about which Marvel superhero he'd choose if he had complete creative control.\nGunn's reaction raised fears that he was leaving the Marvel Cinematic Universe following Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3. However, he quickly clarified that he's only discussing where his thinking is at the moment and that he has no idea what will happen tomorrow or in the next years.</p>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <div class=\"ArticleBody_twitter__xokII\">\n                <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">There are presently no characters at either Marvel or DC that I want to be working with right now that I am not.</p>— James Gunn (@JamesGunn) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JamesGunn/status/1514998885286096897?ref_src=twsrc^tfw\">April 15, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n                </div>","\n                <div class=\"ArticleBody_twitter__xokII\">\n                <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Whatever the case, I’m currently working on a lot of projects, including a few unknown to the general public, & I’m speaking for where I am right this moment, not tomorrow or next year or five years down the line.</p>— James Gunn (@JamesGunn) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JamesGunn/status/1515326648366907404?ref_src=twsrc^tfw\">April 16, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n                </div>","\n                <div>\n                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>It's hardly shocking to see James Gunn address his Marvel Cinematic Universe future in this way.\nHe's already stated that he has no intentions for a fourth Guardians of the Galaxy film, and that the third installment marks the end of the present edition of the crew. Gunn continued to claim that he had no idea what his future held in 2021, however he did confess that Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.\n3 was very certainly his final Marvel picture. He also noted in the same interview that he appreciates parts of DC's multiverse's originality and independence, which allowed him to create The Suicide Squad and Peacemaker. Gunn, on the other hand, appears to be undecided about whether or not he'll return to the Marvel Cinematic Universe following Guardians of the Galaxy 3.</p>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <div>\n                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Although it's natural that fans want to see Gunn stay in the MCU, he'll have to go at some point, and Guardians of the Galaxy 3 might be that moment. Aside from Marvel - and DC, for that matter - he's working on a number of other projects. After all, the third installment of the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. By the time Avengers 3 comes out in 2023, he'll have been a member of the MCU for more than a decade. Since James Gunn has stated that the picture also sets up the next 10-20 years of Marvel's cosmic adventures, it's likely that the film is being used to establish an exciting future for Marvel Studios that he may enjoy as a fan or as a partner.</p>\n                </div>\n                "]},"reco":[{"id":"6827305d-b11e-44da-9c7c-3746dc274bca","date":"May 20, 2022","author":"Brian Martin","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52086874610_0c8116f5f8_c.jpg","title":"8 Best Anne Hathaway Movies That You Should Start Watching","tags":"movie news","excerpt":"Few actresses have the variety of Annie, who has appeared in everything from rom-coms to Oscar-winning musicals."},{"id":"f3a18b76-fab6-40a5-946f-b0c36079bb14","date":"May 20, 2022","author":"Brian Martin","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52085954343_8b563cb528_o.png","title":"Quentin Tarantino Discusses How John Carpenter's 'The Thing' Influenced the Making of 'Reservoir Dogs’","tags":"movie news","excerpt":"And why one of the few films that scares him is 'The Thing.’"},{"id":"ea5bcadb-6b70-41d4-aace-29cfb3824434","date":"May 18, 2022","author":"Brian Martin","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52082671695_1bbb5391a0_c.jpg","title":"Where Did 'The Godfather Part IV' Go?
