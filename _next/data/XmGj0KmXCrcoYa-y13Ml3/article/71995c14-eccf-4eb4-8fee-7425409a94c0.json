Aubameyang went to the field's sidelines after scoring a goal, picked up a transparent orange orb, and placed two fingers on his brow, recreating the pose that Dragon Ball protagonist Son Goku strikes when he uses his Instant Transmission ability, which allows him to teleport great distances in the blink of an eye. \"It was a ball from Dragon Ball. With it, you can make a wish. I wanted to win and score a goal for my grandparents, who are gone,\" the player subsequently stated, confirming that it was a conscious homage to the iconic shonen manga.</pre>","\n                <div class='ArticleBody_imageContainer__ktXae'>\n                <img src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FOVS85_WUAIzcCU?format=jpg&name=large\" alt=\"anime, dragonball, goku, kakarot\">\n                </div>","<pre class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>On his personal Twitter account, Aubameyang later tweeted a photo of himself striking the position with a photo of Goku. \"Hello from a finished player,\" the multi-time Premier League top scorer said, mocking critics who claimed his career was gone after leaving Arsenal. Aubameyang's Twitter profile photo has been changed to a portrait of himself drawn in the style of Akira Toriyama's classic painting. The player is well-known for his eye-catching post-goal celebrations, which frequently include a flip. Aubameyang has also done a \"Wakanda Forever\" salute while wearing a Black Panther mask and celebrating a victory.</pre>","<pre class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Goku is taught the Instant Transmission technique by the friendly people of the planet Yardat after crashing there following his planet-destroying battle with Frieza in the original Dragon Ball manga and the Dragon Ball Z anime. Goku not only exploits his ability to travel throughout the world to surprise opponents, but he has also integrated it into his combat technique, blending it with his famous Kamehameha and Spirit Bomb assaults. The Saiyan warrior most recently employed the technique in the Dragon Ball Super manga's current chapter, where he used it to buy time in his combat with the wish-powered warrior Gas.</pre>","<pre class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Toriyama created Dragon Ball in 1984, and it is now the third best-selling manga of all time, with more than 300 million copies in print worldwide. The ongoing Dragon Ball Super manga, which is still overseen by Toriyama himself and incorporates art by his protégé, Toyotarou, continues Goku's exploits to this day.</pre>"]},"reco":[{"id":"e9eab11e-50b8-49a6-95ff-6cb609eae058","date":"Mar 28, 2022","author":"Wallace Bell","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51966787761_74d8f5389c_c.jpg","title":"James Gunn Reacts to Peacemaker's Intro Dance Being Recreated At a Talent Show","tags":"tv news","excerpt":"James Gunn reacts to a high-school talent competition that recreates the dance sequence from Peacemaker, claiming that the original was shot in a comparable auditorium."},{"id":"9d5ca4b8-c628-4586-a800-ea074863184d","date":"Mar 28, 2022","author":"Nick Carver","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51965763342_3e42506d42_c.jpg","title":"Will Smith Smacking Chris Rock At The Oscars In 2022 Appears To Have Jaden Smith's Support","tags":"movie news","excerpt":"Will Smith struck Chris Rock after the latter's Jada Pinkett Smith joke at the 2022 Oscars, prompting Jaden Smith to express his support for his father."},{"id":"d01af9b7-84fe-4724-94b5-cfeacf781686","date":"Mar 28, 2022","author":"Wallace Bell","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51966817133_c39a87085b_c.jpg","title":"Oscar Isaac Compares Joining The Marvel Cinematic Universe As Moon Knight To Star Wars And Dune","tags":"tv news","excerpt":"Oscar Isaac compares working on Star Wars and last year's Dune to joining the Marvel Cinematic Universe as Steven Grant in Moon Knight."},{"id":"c8d944af-1b0d-4791-9664-7109dd706711","date":"Mar 23, 2022","author":"Nick Carver","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51956197919_10291798e9_o.png","title":"'Drive My Car,' an Oscar-nominated film by Ryusuke Hamaguchi, has been added to the Criterion Collection","tags":"movie news","excerpt":"'Drive My Car' is the first Japanese film to receive an Oscar nomination for Best Picture."}]},"__N_SSG":true}
