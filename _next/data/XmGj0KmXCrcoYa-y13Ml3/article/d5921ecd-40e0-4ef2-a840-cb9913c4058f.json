The show depicts harmless games turned deadly, turning childhood favorites like tug of war and even marbles into murderous activities, but Squid Game's most renowned game was its opening event. Red Light Green Light, one of the show's most dangerous games, required participants to halt moving when a terrifying, huge mechanical doll turned around. The doll has also become something of an unofficial Squid Game mascot, with a group of enthusiasts recently attempting to build the robot in real life.</pre>","\n                <div class='ArticleBody_related__oI_Nm'>\n                <p class='ArticleBody_relatedCap__07hkO'>RELATED:</p>\n                <a class='ArticleBody_relatedTitle__uyeq1' href='https://www.themoviebureau.com/article/7a18b13f-67ef-48a9-8715-35704015c3f8'>The Creator Of The Squid Game Reveals Plans To Bring Back</a>\n                </div>\n                ","<pre class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Showrunner Dong-hyuk has now revealed that he has more game ideas for Season 2, even if he isn't ready to release them just yet.</pre>","\n                <div class='ArticleBody_quote__9rdnr'>\n                <p>There will be more great games, that’s all I can say.

Dong-hyuk has a plethora of possibilities to make Season 2 as successful as Season 1 with such a vibrant and innovative premise. More Squid Game, on the other hand, appears to be a long way off, which isn't necessarily a bad thing because fans of the program will no doubt want Dong-hyuk to take his time bringing future seasons to life.</pre>","<pre class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>After the cliffhanger finish of Season 1, Squid Game could have easily moved away from more games and taken a whole other path. Despite receiving a warning from the game's leaders, the show's star and single survivor, Seong Gi-hun, set out to end the games once and for all. With Dong-hyuk already organizing his next round of lethal games, it appears that Seong will be involved in more terrifying Squid Game competitions in the future.</pre>"]},"reco":[{"id":"e9eab11e-50b8-49a6-95ff-6cb609eae058","date":"Mar 28, 2022","author":"Wallace Bell","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51966787761_74d8f5389c_c.jpg","title":"James Gunn Reacts to Peacemaker's Intro Dance Being Recreated At a Talent Show","tags":"tv news","excerpt":"James Gunn reacts to a high-school talent competition that recreates the dance sequence from Peacemaker, claiming that the original was shot in a comparable auditorium."},{"id":"9d5ca4b8-c628-4586-a800-ea074863184d","date":"Mar 28, 2022","author":"Nick Carver","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51965763342_3e42506d42_c.jpg","title":"Will Smith Smacking Chris Rock At The Oscars In 2022 Appears To Have Jaden Smith's Support","tags":"movie news","excerpt":"Will Smith struck Chris Rock after the latter's Jada Pinkett Smith joke at the 2022 Oscars, prompting Jaden Smith to express his support for his father."},{"id":"d01af9b7-84fe-4724-94b5-cfeacf781686","date":"Mar 28, 2022","author":"Wallace Bell","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51966817133_c39a87085b_c.jpg","title":"Oscar Isaac Compares Joining The Marvel Cinematic Universe As Moon Knight To Star Wars And Dune","tags":"tv news","excerpt":"Oscar Isaac compares working on Star Wars and last year's Dune to joining the Marvel Cinematic Universe as Steven Grant in Moon Knight."},{"id":"71995c14-eccf-4eb4-8fee-7425409a94c0","date":"Mar 23, 2022","author":"Kohei Watanabe","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51956013878_29e059cdb5_c.jpg","title":"Barcelona Footballer Pays Tribute To Goku From Dragon Ball Z","tags":"anime news","excerpt":"During a match against Real Madrid, FC Barcelona footballer Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang shows off his Dragon Ball fandom."}]},"__N_SSG":true}
