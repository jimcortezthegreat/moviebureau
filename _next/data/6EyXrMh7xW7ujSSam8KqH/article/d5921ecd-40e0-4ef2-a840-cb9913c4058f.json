The show follows 456 people who enter a competition in the hopes of winning a life-changing sum if they can survive the show's dangerous games. Squid Game's success was recently recognized at this year's award season, with the program winning three SAG awards and a Golden Globe, among other accolades.</p>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <div>\n                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>While the popularity of Squid Game can be attributed to outstanding storytelling and world-building, the game's major draw is its unusual and horrifying assortment of tournaments. The show depicts harmless games turned deadly, turning childhood favorites like tug of war and even marbles into murderous activities, but Squid Game's most renowned game was its opening event. Red Light Green Light, one of the show's most dangerous games, required participants to halt moving when a terrifying, huge mechanical doll turned around. The doll has also become something of an unofficial Squid Game mascot, with a group of enthusiasts recently attempting to build the robot in real life.</p>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <div class='ArticleBody_related__oI_Nm'>\n                <p class='ArticleBody_relatedCap__07hkO'>RELATED:</p>\n                <a class='ArticleBody_relatedTitle__uyeq1' href='https://www.themoviebureau.com/article/7a18b13f-67ef-48a9-8715-35704015c3f8'>The Creator Of The Squid Game Reveals Plans To Bring Back</a>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <div>\n                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Showrunner Dong-hyuk has now revealed that he has more game ideas for Season 2, even if he isn't ready to release them just yet.</p>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <div class='ArticleBody_quote__9rdnr'>\n                <p>There will be more great games, that’s all I can say.

Dong-hyuk has a plethora of possibilities to make Season 2 as successful as Season 1 with such a vibrant and innovative premise. More Squid Game, on the other hand, appears to be a long way off, which isn't necessarily a bad thing because fans of the program will no doubt want Dong-hyuk to take his time bringing future seasons to life.</p>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <div>\n                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>After the cliffhanger finish of Season 1, Squid Game could have easily moved away from more games and taken a whole other path. Despite receiving a warning from the game's leaders, the show's star and single survivor, Seong Gi-hun, set out to end the games once and for all. With Dong-hyuk already organizing his next round of lethal games, it appears that Seong will be involved in more terrifying Squid Game competitions in the future.</p>\n                </div>\n                "]},"reco":[{"id":"b21195fa-f5aa-476d-9b96-1b88d1231aed","date":"Jul 15, 2022","author":"Brian Martin","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52217394266_7172bf92d7_o.png","title":"The Russo Brothers Reveal Their Favorite Marvel Phase 4 Movie","tags":"movie news","excerpt":"The co-director of the blockbuster Avengers: Endgame, Joe Russo, reveals which of Marvel's Phase 4 films he thinks is “pitch-perfect.”"},{"id":"752f193e-a990-4687-80d9-2b09f15e536b","date":"Jul 15, 2022","author":"Brian Martin","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52217253121_c911bcc830_o.png","title":"David Fincher’s Zodiac: 15 Years Later","tags":"movie news","excerpt":"Why the Zodiac Killer is still a ghostly presence in our lives years after David Fincher's masterpiece."},{"id":"f604210e-6a8c-4508-9669-4745d39bf7c0","date":"Jul 13, 2022","author":"Brian Martin","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52212039877_a813967c89_o.png","title":"How the Marvel Cinematic Universe was influenced by The Dark Knight","tags":"movie news","excerpt":"Although The Dark Knight is often regarded as the pinnacle of superhero movies, did it really have an influence on the more well-known Marvel Cinematic Universe?"},{"id":"52fb1f69-c802-4d2b-b1ef-6d650023ddd4","date":"Jul 12, 2022","author":"Brian Martin","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52211207270_90e58bd2f3_o.png","title":"Moon Knight Season 2: What To Expect","tags":"tv news","excerpt":"Although the MCU series' second season has not yet been announced, creator Jeremy Slater has ambitious intentions if Moon Knight is given a second chance."}]},"__N_SSG":true}
