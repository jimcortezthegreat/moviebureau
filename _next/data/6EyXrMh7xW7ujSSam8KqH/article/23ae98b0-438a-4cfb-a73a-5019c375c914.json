It is not an exaggeration to say this. Arrow lasted eight seasons and inspired over a half-dozen spinoffs, several of which are still on the air today. Years before its major competition in the shared universe sweepstakes, the MCU, even considered the potential of the multiverse, it addressed the most ambitious comic book plot of all time in real action. It also made Stephen Amell, the starring actor, a star.</p>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <div>\n                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Heels, a Starz drama about the ups and downs of an indie professional wrestling promotion, stars Amell. As the program was wrapping up its first season back in September 2021, the issue of Arrow came up. While we haven't officially celebrated ten years of Arrow on television, it has been ten years since Amell was cast as Oliver Queen. DC was honoring the 80th anniversary of Green Arrow.</p>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <div class='ArticleBody_quote__9rdnr'>\n                <p>”In the pilot episode when I threaten Adam Hunt and I tell him to transfer something to Starling City Bank…it was bank account 1141. That is November 1941, in honor of [the first comic book appearance of] Green Arrow…10 years, that’s 1/8 of the time that this character has been around. So I think of myself as a I’m an ambassador for the character. I got to wear the hat with the feather, so to speak, but not done the goatee for a short period of time, and that makes me very proud.”</p>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <div class='ArticleBody_imageContainer__ktXae'>\n                <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52050754007_1f93e5e6b1_b.jpg\" alt=\"Stephen Amell Arrow, Stephen Amell Oliver Queen Arrow\">\n                </div>","\n                <div>\n                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Not only did Amell portray Oliver Queen for eight seasons of Arrow, plus a few guest appearances, but he also got to achieve something that only a few superhero actors have ever done: he got to end his character's tale. And in a suitably heroic manner, no less. The Green Arrow's narrative culminated with Crisis on Infinite Earths, and the individual who began it all turned out to be the key to preserving the multiverse.</p>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <div class='ArticleBody_quote__9rdnr'>\n                <p>”What means a great deal to me is we did get to control the ending. That happens so rarely. To have that conversation with Greg Berlanti during the sixth season, and to decide that seven and then a truncated version of the eighth season would wrap up the story, it’s just such a blessing, because we got to do it the right way. We got to say goodbye to people in the right way. In my opinion, the way it should end for any superhero without superpowers is in the ground. Although I think Oliver just turned into energy. So you know, never say never.”</p>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <div>\n                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>When he was asked if he could ever picture himself picking up Oliver's bow again after that “never say never” comment.</p>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <div class='ArticleBody_quote__9rdnr'>\n                <p>”Oh, sure. I owe so much to the people of DC, The CW, and Warner Bros. Television. I love the character so much and only love it more now that it’s coming up on two years since we wrapped the show….But having a little space now, I saw that I miss it. I do look back very, very, very fondly on it….Listen, I’m the namesake. So if I can ever be of any any help, if I can be of service to the Arrowverse in any way, shape or form, or better still take it to a new place, which I think would be the more interesting route to go, be that in a limited capacity or on a different platform, maybe one where we could show blood, that’d be really cool.”</p>\n                </div>\n                "]},"reco":[{"id":"b21195fa-f5aa-476d-9b96-1b88d1231aed","date":"Jul 15, 2022","author":"Brian Martin","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52217394266_7172bf92d7_o.png","title":"The Russo Brothers Reveal Their Favorite Marvel Phase 4 Movie","tags":"movie news","excerpt":"The co-director of the blockbuster Avengers: Endgame, Joe Russo, reveals which of Marvel's Phase 4 films he thinks is “pitch-perfect.”"},{"id":"752f193e-a990-4687-80d9-2b09f15e536b","date":"Jul 15, 2022","author":"Brian Martin","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52217253121_c911bcc830_o.png","title":"David Fincher’s Zodiac: 15 Years Later","tags":"movie news","excerpt":"Why the Zodiac Killer is still a ghostly presence in our lives years after David Fincher's masterpiece."},{"id":"f604210e-6a8c-4508-9669-4745d39bf7c0","date":"Jul 13, 2022","author":"Brian Martin","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52212039877_a813967c89_o.png","title":"How the Marvel Cinematic Universe was influenced by The Dark Knight","tags":"movie news","excerpt":"Although The Dark Knight is often regarded as the pinnacle of superhero movies, did it really have an influence on the more well-known Marvel Cinematic Universe?"},{"id":"52fb1f69-c802-4d2b-b1ef-6d650023ddd4","date":"Jul 12, 2022","author":"Brian Martin","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52211207270_90e58bd2f3_o.png","title":"Moon Knight Season 2: What To Expect","tags":"tv news","excerpt":"Although the MCU series' second season has not yet been announced, creator Jeremy Slater has ambitious intentions if Moon Knight is given a second chance."}]},"__N_SSG":true}
