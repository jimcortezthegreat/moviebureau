Johnny Depp is also noted for playing some of the oddest and most bizarre parts in film over the previous four decades. Depp interprets the character based on what is written on the page of the screenplay.\nAt the very least, the result is a memorable character. At the very least, it's a memorable film to go with the persona.</p>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <div>\n                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>His personal image may have suffered in recent years, but his career has not, thanks to appearances in the Fantastic Beasts flicks and other high-profile ventures.

The film stars Johnny Depp as Victor and Helena Bonham Carter as Emily, a zombie who believes she is Victor's Corpse Bride in a stop-motion animation that is viewed as a spiritual sequel to The Nightmare Before Christmas.</p>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <div>\n                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Based on 197 reviews, the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported an 84 percent approval rating with an average rating of 7.2/10. \"As can be expected from a Tim Burton movie, Corpse Bride is whimsically macabre, visually imaginative, and emotionally bittersweet,\" according to the site's critical consensus. Metacritic, a review aggregator that assigns a score out of 100 based on top reviews from mainstream critics, calculated a score of 83 based on 35 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim.\" On a scale of A+ to F, audiences polled by CinemaScore awarded the picture an average grade of \"B+.\" The film was nominated for the 78th Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, but it was defeated by Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit, which also starred Helena Bonham Carter. This film was nominated for the American Film Institute's Top 10 Animation Films list in 2008.</p>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <h2 class=\"ArticleBody_heading__tc5g4\">Blow</h2>\n                ","\n                <div class='ArticleBody_imageContainer__ktXae'>\n                <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52002478442_577865dc27_b.jpg\" alt=\"netflix, johnny depp, chill, blow, the tourist, mortdecai\">\n                </div>","\n                <div>\n                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>With the exception of J.M. The majority of Johnny Depp's biographical portrayals are outlaws and renegades, according to Barries. On that list, George Jung is at the top. In Blow, he plays a man who assisted in the importation of cocaine into the United States, and he does so with the swagger of a rock star.</p>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <div>\n                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Jung risks everything for the good life, driven by the ambition to never be poor.

The film received a \"A-\" on an A+ to F rating from audiences polled by CinemaScore.</p>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <h2 class=\"ArticleBody_heading__tc5g4\">Mortdecai</h2>\n                ","\n                <div class='ArticleBody_imageContainer__ktXae'>\n                <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52004022910_bf50c6aefd_b.jpg\" alt=\"netflix, johnny depp, chill, blow, the tourist, mortdecai\">\n                </div>","\n                <div>\n                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Depp plays Charlie Mortdecai, a borderline dissolute roué and cad who works as an art dealer of dubious means and morals who, as the film begins, owes the British government over 8 million pounds in back taxes and is on the verge of losing everything, save for his newly cultivated walrus-style mustache. One person who would like to see him lose his stache is Johanna (Gwyneth Paltrow), his otherwise loving and infinitely patient wife, whose gag reflex goes into overdrive whenever she comes into close contact with the soup strainer in question, a trait shared by Mortdecai and, presumably, most members of the audience.</p>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <div>\n                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Not only is it a one-joke characterization, but the joke is on the level of a below-average knock-knock joke. Johnny Depp delivers another one of the self-consciously campy turns that he has been giving viewers in lieu of actual performances—not only is it a one-joke characterization, but the joke is on the level of a below-average knock-knock joke. This performance, like the rest of the picture, is such a terrible error that you almost want to keep watching just to see how much worse it can get until it eventually comes to a merciful and long-overdue finish.</p>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <h2 class=\"ArticleBody_heading__tc5g4\">The Tourist</h2>\n                ","\n                <div class='ArticleBody_imageContainer__ktXae'>\n                <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52002478227_20371b385e_b.jpg\" alt=\"netflix, johnny depp, chill, blow, the tourist, mortdecai\">\n                </div>","\n                <div>\n                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Angelina Jolie gives it her all as the mysterious woman. She understands the humor. At this film, she begins in a Paris cafe, eludes detectives by scurrying into the Metro, boards an overnight train to Venice, picks up a mysterious man (Johnny Depp), and checks them both into the Royal Danelli without a wrinkle on her clothing or a hair out of place.</p>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <div>\n                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Depp plays the accommodating, love-struck straight guy who gets sucked into someone else's problems in the Cary Grant character. These two should, in principle, indulge in clever flirting and sardonic understatement. No one appears to have informed Depp that the film is a farce in practice. Of course, I'm referring about farce in the dictionary sense: a humorous dramatic production that employs buffoonery and horseplay, as well as coarse characterisation and ludicrously impossible scenarios. Depp, on the other hand, takes his math teacher seriously and with a hint of melancholy.</p>\n                </div>\n                "]},"reco":[{"id":"b21195fa-f5aa-476d-9b96-1b88d1231aed","date":"Jul 15, 2022","author":"Brian Martin","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52217394266_7172bf92d7_o.png","title":"The Russo Brothers Reveal Their Favorite Marvel Phase 4 Movie","tags":"movie news","excerpt":"The co-director of the blockbuster Avengers: Endgame, Joe Russo, reveals which of Marvel's Phase 4 films he thinks is “pitch-perfect.”"},{"id":"752f193e-a990-4687-80d9-2b09f15e536b","date":"Jul 15, 2022","author":"Brian Martin","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52217253121_c911bcc830_o.png","title":"David Fincher’s Zodiac: 15 Years Later","tags":"movie news","excerpt":"Why the Zodiac Killer is still a ghostly presence in our lives years after David Fincher's masterpiece."},{"id":"f604210e-6a8c-4508-9669-4745d39bf7c0","date":"Jul 13, 2022","author":"Brian Martin","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52212039877_a813967c89_o.png","title":"How the Marvel Cinematic Universe was influenced by The Dark Knight","tags":"movie news","excerpt":"Although The Dark Knight is often regarded as the pinnacle of superhero movies, did it really have an influence on the more well-known Marvel Cinematic Universe?"},{"id":"52fb1f69-c802-4d2b-b1ef-6d650023ddd4","date":"Jul 12, 2022","author":"Brian Martin","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52211207270_90e58bd2f3_o.png","title":"Moon Knight Season 2: What To Expect","tags":"tv news","excerpt":"Although the MCU series' second season has not yet been announced, creator Jeremy Slater has ambitious intentions if Moon Knight is given a second chance."}]},"__N_SSG":true}
