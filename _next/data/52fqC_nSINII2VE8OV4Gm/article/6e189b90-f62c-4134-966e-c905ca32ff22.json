Mario O'Hara and Lamberto E. Antonio wrote the screenplay, which is based on O'Hara's teleplay of the same name. The film stars Hilda Koronel as the titular figure, a young daughter of a spiteful mother (Mona Lisa), whose much-younger lover (Ruel Vernal) rapes her in the slums of Tondo, Manila. Insiang seeks vengeance after her assault and the betrayal of her own boyfriend (Rez Cortez). The film, which depicts urban poverty, examines themes of betrayal, revenge, and despair.</p>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <div>\n                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>It is the first Philippine film to be screened at the Cannes Film Festival and to be shot in Tondo.\nInsiang, although being a box office flop, earned positive reviews from reviewers (some of whom rated it as one of Brocka's greatest). Producer Ruby Tiong Tan surrendered the film's rights to the Film Development Committee of the Philippines in 2015 so that the council may explore its restoration with Martin Scorsese's The Film Foundation, a nonprofit dedicated to film preservation.\nThe restored version was chosen for the Cannes Classics section of the 2015 Cannes Film Festival and has since screened at a number of additional film festivals.</p>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <div>\n                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Themes of betrayal, revenge, and sorrow are explored in Insiang. \"The film is basically a character study of a young girl growing up in the slums. I wanted to show the violence of the overcrowded neighborhoods; the loss of human dignity caused by the social environment and the ensuing need for change.\" says Lino Brocka. It's been linked to the rape and revenge subgenre. The film's opening scene, which depicts pigs being killed, was \"a thinly veiled depiction of the plight of the Filipinos under the Martial Law regime,\" according to CNN Philippines' Don Jaucian. The slaughterhouse scene has been linked by some observers to the country's poverty.</p>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <h2 class=\"ArticleBody_heading__tc5g4\">Manila in the Claws of Light (1975)</h2>\n                ","\n                <div class='ArticleBody_imageContainer__ktXae'>\n                <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51975550897_795dc80854_b.jpg\" alt=\"lino brocka, filipino movies, tagalog movies, films\">\n                </div>","\n                <div>\n                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Manila in the Claws of Light (Tagalog: Maynila, sa mga Kuko ng Liwanag) is a 1975 Filipino drama film directed by Lino Brocka and based on Edgardo M.

When Jaguar is compared to Direk, Sonny, and his buddies, who have nothing on him except being born affluent, this comment becomes even more pointed, with the latter's attitude, in which he constantly recalls his father whenever he is in trouble, being a prime example of this criticism.</p>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <div>\n                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>At the same time, Cristy, who comes from a similar background as Jaguar, takes a completely opposite path, with Brocka implying that women, in particular, may f*ck their way to the top, and that women in general can use their attractiveness to succeed in life.
