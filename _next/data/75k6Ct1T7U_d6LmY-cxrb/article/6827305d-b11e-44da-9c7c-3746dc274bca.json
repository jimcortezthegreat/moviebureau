A quick glance at her resume reveals an excellent mix of rom-coms, love dramas, Christopher Nolan's postmodern cinematic stylings, and a bevy of awards—not to mention, she's the uncontested queen of the onscreen glow up. We reflect on Hathaway's finest work as she returns to our screens in the Apple TV+ series WeCrashed, which focuses on the love story at the core of the growth and demise of the WeWork empire.</p>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <h2 class=\"ArticleBody_heading__tc5g4\">The Princess Diaries (2001)</h2>\n                ","\n                <div class='ArticleBody_imageContainer__ktXae'>\n                <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52086398138_43a4c732a0_b.jpg\" alt=\"best Anne Hathaway movies, Anne Hathaway films available\">\n                </div>","\n                <div>\n                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Did you ever state when you were five that you wanted to be a princess when you grew up? When Mia Thermopolis, a popular 15-year-old, learns that her father is Crown Prince Philippe Renaldi of Genovia, her childhood desire comes true. Mia already had enough to deal with at high school, but now she has to deal with the reality of being royalty, which include a flood of tabloid interest in her personal life and a handful of phony pals hoping for their own 15 minutes of fame. Hathaway has remarked that being able to embrace costar Julie Andrews every day was \"a dream\" during filming the picture, which is based on Meg Cabot's novels.</p>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <h2 class=\"ArticleBody_heading__tc5g4\">Les Misérables (2012)</h2>\n                ","\n                <div class='ArticleBody_imageContainer__ktXae'>\n                <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52085341957_6cf5e2154e_b.jpg\" alt=\"best Anne Hathaway movies, Anne Hathaway films available\">\n                </div>","\n                <div>\n                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>In the cinematic version of Victor Hugo's epic novel, Hathaway won more than ten accolades for her role as Fantine, a factory seamstress turned sex prostitute. The praises are all the more astounding since Hathaway barely had roughly half an hour of screen time in the three-hour picture. Anyone who can sing like that while making it plain that their character is suffering an emotional breakdown deserves admiration.</p>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <h2 class=\"ArticleBody_heading__tc5g4\">Ella Enchanted (2004)</h2>\n                ","\n                <div class='ArticleBody_imageContainer__ktXae'>\n                <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52086398608_198995bf5f_b.jpg\" alt=\"best Anne Hathaway movies, Anne Hathaway films available\">\n                </div>","\n                <div>\n                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>A fairy godmother bestows a \"virtuous gift\" on each kid at birth in this beautiful planet. Ella, on the other hand, has an unquestioning loyalty that feels more like a curse. As a result, Ella sets off on a mission to find her fairy godmother and break the curse, exhibiting her moral courage and conviction. It's a playful take on the fairy-tale genre, and it gives Hathaway the opportunity to show off her tremendous vocal abilities.</p>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <h2 class=\"ArticleBody_heading__tc5g4\">The Devil Wears Prada (2006)</h2>\n                ","\n                <div class='ArticleBody_imageContainer__ktXae'>\n                <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52086398688_afae538804_b.jpg\" alt=\"best Anne Hathaway movies, Anne Hathaway films available\">\n                </div>","\n                <div>\n                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Under the chilly direction of Editor-in-Chief Miranda Priestly, aspiring news writer Andy Sachs (Hathaway) accepts a position as an editorial assistant at a high-fashion magazine (Meryl Streep). Despite earning a job that \"a million females would kill for,\" Andy isn't one of them, viewing the position as only a stepping stone. Andy physically pulls herself up by her Chanel bootstraps and goes to work after creative director Nigel's scathing speech about her obviously ungrateful attitude, putting her personal connections to the test.

Love and Other Drugs stars Jake Gyllenhaal as the womanizing (really, sort of predatory) pharmaceutical salesperson Jamie in the 1990s, when the erectile dysfunction medicine Viagra had just entered the market. He meets Maggie, a free-spirited young woman, by coincidence (Hathaway). Both insist they aren't seeking for a long-term commitment, but what begins as a casual affair quickly turns into something far more difficult as feelings emerge. When Maggie's medical condition is disclosed, the joyful romantic comedy turns gears, and the two protagonists wonder where their relationship is heading.</p>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <h2 class=\"ArticleBody_heading__tc5g4\">Interstellar (2014)</h2>\n                ","\n                <div class='ArticleBody_imageContainer__ktXae'>\n                <img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52086620049_a0adfc4ab7_k.jpg\" alt=\"best Anne Hathaway movies, Anne Hathaway films available\">\n                </div>","\n                <div>\n                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Hathaway plays Dr. Amelia Brand, the lead scientist of an expedition committed to transferring the human species, in a bleak future when climate change, dust storms, and a shortage of resources have rendered Earth inhospitable.

Hathaway plays Selina Kyle, a.k.a. Catwoman (though she's never called that), a smooth-talking, \"slinky\" (in Hathaway's words) burglar searching for a fresh start in Christopher Nolan's trilogy of noir-ish Batman flicks.
