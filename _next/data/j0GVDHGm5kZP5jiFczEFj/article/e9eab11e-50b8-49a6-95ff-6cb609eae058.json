The series, which stars John Cena as the titular hero/antihero, is a direct spinoff from James Gunn's The Suicide Group, and follows the vicious mercenary as he is recruited by Amanda Waller's A.R.G.U.S. to join another black ops squad. They've been tasked with dealing with an extraterrestrial menace in the shape of parasitic butterfly-like organisms who've taken up residence in human bodies.</p>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <div>\n                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Gunn established the tone for his series with an exhilarating, choreographed introduction dance sequence set to Wig Wam's \"Do You Wanna Taste It?\" Gunn set the tone for his series with an exhilarating, choreographed introductory dance sequence set to Wig Wam's \"Do You Wanna Taste It?\" \"No kidding, we shot the actual opening in a school auditorium not so different from that,\" Gunn said to a tweet showing the sequence being reproduced for a high-school talent competition.</p>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <div class=\"ArticleBody_twitter__xokII\">\n                <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">No kidding, we shot the actual opening in a school auditorium not so different from that. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Peacemaker?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc^tfw\">#Peacemaker</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/S9IsLv8ReU\">https://t.co/S9IsLv8ReU</a></p>â€” James Gunn (@JamesGunn) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JamesGunn/status/1507732545470971905?ref_src=twsrc^tfw\">March 26, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n                </div>","\n                <div>\n                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Peacemaker has already been renewed for a second season, so fans will be interested to see what happens with the beginning dance sequence as fresh episodes air. Given that several of the characters from the original scene are no longer alive, such as Annie Chang's Detective Sophie Song and Robert Patrick's Auggie Smith, the sequence is likely to be re-choreographed and re-filmed. The launch date for Peacemaker season 2 has yet to be revealed, so fans may have to wait a while to watch more of John Cena's dance moves.</p>\n                </div>\n                "]},"reco":[{"id":"4d13c42f-a764-4383-b22f-42f0adc6a026","date":"Apr 22, 2022","author":"Brian Martin","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52021844280_1c1bffcb35_c.jpg","title":"Casting What-Ifs: Every Actor That Came Close To Playing Captain Jack Sparrow","tags":"movie news","excerpt":"In the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, Johnny Depp played Jack Sparrow, but who else came close to captaining the Black Pearl?"},{"id":"565c5bdf-8b55-48f4-b7cf-77b659a6f1d8","date":"Apr 21, 2022","author":"Alfred Bright","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52019132086_e3bdd48150_c.jpg","title":"According to the creators of Stranger Things Season 5, fans will be left wanting more","tags":"tv news","excerpt":"According to Matt Duffer, the Netflix show's creator, Stranger Things ending with season 5 will feel a touch premature and leave viewers wanting more."},{"id":"c530afb2-8320-4674-8b39-b048f35eb734","date":"Apr 20, 2022","author":"Brian Martin","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52017181691_f759ac5e2c_c.jpg","title":"Johnny Depp claims that he never saw the first Pirates of the Caribbean film","tags":"movie news","excerpt":"Johnny Depp admits during his testimony against Amber Heard that he has never watched Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl."},{"id":"6aaccbb4-6493-42c1-8fc3-ac50461d0c27","date":"Apr 19, 2022","author":"Brian Martin","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52014966154_e145713a34_c.jpg","title":"Josh Brolin Is Open To Returning To The Marvel Cinematic Universe As Thanos","tags":"movie news","excerpt":"Josh Brolin talks about his future in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and reveals that if Marvel asks, he is willing to reprise his role as Thanos."}]},"__N_SSG":true}
