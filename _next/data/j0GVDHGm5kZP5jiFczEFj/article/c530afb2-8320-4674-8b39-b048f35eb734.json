The first Pirates of the Caribbean film, released in 2003, was a huge smash with audiences and launched a multi-billion-dollar franchise. Captain Jack Sparrow, played by Johnny Depp, was introduced to viewers in Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, a beloved figure who would go on to feature in all four sequels, the most recent of which, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales, was released in 2017.</p>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <div>\n                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>The possibility of a sixth Pirates of the Caribbean film has been discussed since before the fifth, but no new information has been released about the project in a long time. The production of a sixth Pirates of the Caribbean film might possibly be hampered by Depp's current legal issues. The 58-year-old actor's troubled marriage with ex-wife Amber Heard has long been the topic of tabloid headlines, and the two stars' bitter spat has now moved to the courtroom, with Depp suing Heard for $50 million in defamation.</p>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <div>\n                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Depp's evidence in court against Heard included an unexpected admission: he'd never seen Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, according to Matthew Belloni, creator of Puck News. Belloni considers Depp's admission \"a baller move,\" noting that he was nominated for Best Actor at the 2004 Academy Awards for his performance as Sparrow.</p>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <div class=\"ArticleBody_twitter__xokII\">\n                <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Johnny Depp just said in court he never saw the first PIRATES movie.

Depp, who has previously stated that he does not enjoy viewing his own films, joins the ranks of Meryl Streep, Joaquin Phoenix, Javier Bardem, and Reese Witherspoon as performers who skip their own films. While it may seem strange that Depp didn't see a film for which he was nominated for an Academy Award, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl appears to be only the latest in a long series of Depp films that he hasn't seen.</p>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <div>\n                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>It's unclear how Depp's current legal issues will affect the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise's future. Even said, it's becoming increasingly improbable that Depp would reprise his role as Captain Jack Sparrow. The Pirates of the Caribbean series may have to learn to thrive without Depp's presence, with a spinoff reportedly in production with Margot Robbie attached to feature. Many fans believe the latter episodes are notably worse than Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl and the other two original trilogy films, therefore it could be a good thing for the franchise to receive a fresh start.</p>\n                </div>\n                "]},"reco":[{"id":"4d13c42f-a764-4383-b22f-42f0adc6a026","date":"Apr 22, 2022","author":"Brian Martin","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52021844280_1c1bffcb35_c.jpg","title":"Casting What-Ifs: Every Actor That Came Close To Playing Captain Jack Sparrow","tags":"movie news","excerpt":"In the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, Johnny Depp played Jack Sparrow, but who else came close to captaining the Black Pearl?"},{"id":"565c5bdf-8b55-48f4-b7cf-77b659a6f1d8","date":"Apr 21, 2022","author":"Alfred Bright","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52019132086_e3bdd48150_c.jpg","title":"According to the creators of Stranger Things Season 5, fans will be left wanting more","tags":"tv news","excerpt":"According to Matt Duffer, the Netflix show's creator, Stranger Things ending with season 5 will feel a touch premature and leave viewers wanting more."},{"id":"6aaccbb4-6493-42c1-8fc3-ac50461d0c27","date":"Apr 19, 2022","author":"Brian Martin","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52014966154_e145713a34_c.jpg","title":"Josh Brolin Is Open To Returning To The Marvel Cinematic Universe As Thanos","tags":"movie news","excerpt":"Josh Brolin talks about his future in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and reveals that if Marvel asks, he is willing to reprise his role as Thanos."},{"id":"932dada0-caaa-4647-9b04-9959a41d8da6","date":"Apr 18, 2022","author":"Alfred Bright","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52013114754_bf9a552339_c.jpg","title":"Moon Knight Has Been Active In The MCU For Longer Than Spider-Man, According To Marvel","tags":"tv news","excerpt":"Marc Spector has been active in the MCU for even longer than known heroes like Spider-Man, according to a throwaway phrase in Moon Knight episode 3."}]},"__N_SSG":true}
