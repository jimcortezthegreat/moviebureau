Despite her stubborn spirit, which she shared with the other Stark siblings, she was trained as a Faceless One, which she subsequently used to wreak devastation on her family's adversaries. She became one of the show's most accomplished heroines in Season 8, as she was the one who eventually killed the Night King and defeated the White Walker danger.</p>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <div>\n                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Williams is now being questioned in a GQ piece if she would consider repeating her part in a future Game of Thrones spinoff project. While she doesn't rule it out completely, she makes it clear that her response is in no way a confirmation, and that no such return is presently in the works. Williams, on the other hand, would be open to an Arya comeback provided it made sense for both her career and the Game of Thrones world.</p>\n                </div>\n                ","\n                <div class='ArticleBody_quote__9rdnr'>\n                <p>I’m not saying it would never happen, but I’m also not saying it in this interview so that everyone goes… [gasps] 'The spin-off!

The new series has the advantage of being set a few centuries before the events of its parent program, which means it doesn't have any of the show's narrative baggage and has a genuine chance of recapturing the enchantment that enchanted so many people around the world. Game of Thrones season 8's failure may even work in its advantage, reducing expectations to the point where any amount of success would be welcomed by returning viewers.</p>\n                </div>\n                "]},"reco":[{"id":"4d13c42f-a764-4383-b22f-42f0adc6a026","date":"Apr 22, 2022","author":"Brian Martin","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52021844280_1c1bffcb35_c.jpg","title":"Casting What-Ifs: Every Actor That Came Close To Playing Captain Jack Sparrow","tags":"movie news","excerpt":"In the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, Johnny Depp played Jack Sparrow, but who else came close to captaining the Black Pearl?"},{"id":"565c5bdf-8b55-48f4-b7cf-77b659a6f1d8","date":"Apr 21, 2022","author":"Alfred Bright","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52019132086_e3bdd48150_c.jpg","title":"According to the creators of Stranger Things Season 5, fans will be left wanting more","tags":"tv news","excerpt":"According to Matt Duffer, the Netflix show's creator, Stranger Things ending with season 5 will feel a touch premature and leave viewers wanting more."},{"id":"c530afb2-8320-4674-8b39-b048f35eb734","date":"Apr 20, 2022","author":"Brian Martin","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52017181691_f759ac5e2c_c.jpg","title":"Johnny Depp claims that he never saw the first Pirates of the Caribbean film","tags":"movie news","excerpt":"Johnny Depp admits during his testimony against Amber Heard that he has never watched Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl."},{"id":"6aaccbb4-6493-42c1-8fc3-ac50461d0c27","date":"Apr 19, 2022","author":"Brian Martin","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52014966154_e145713a34_c.jpg","title":"Josh Brolin Is Open To Returning To The Marvel Cinematic Universe As Thanos","tags":"movie news","excerpt":"Josh Brolin talks about his future in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and reveals that if Marvel asks, he is willing to reprise his role as Thanos."}]},"__N_SSG":true}
