                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>What zombie fan doesn't enjoy a good zombie movie? Zombies, on the other hand, aren't just for movies. There are a slew of fantastic TV shows that feature or even star zombies. Indeed, zombie television shows are a subgenre of dramas, thrillers, post-apocalyptic shows, and even comedies. The concept of zombies — undead former humans roaming the streets in search of human flesh to eat – has been addressed from every aspect imaginable.</p>

Liv Moore (get it? ), a Seattle-based medical student, is transformed into a zombie while attending a boat party. She decides to take a job in the morgue as a result of her undead transformation, giving her unrestricted access to brains and allowing her to use her zombie abilities to solve murders. When Liv (and other zombies in this universe) consumes brains, she experiences flashes of the deceased's existence. She passes off her insights as psychic talent (because why not?) and assists Detective Clive Babineaux in solving this week's crime, generally while being completely bizarre as she adopts aspects of the deceased person's personality.</p>

Santa Clarita Diet, starring Drew Barrymore and Timothy Olyphant, follows Sheila, Joel, and Abby Hammond, a typical Californian family of three, when Sheila develops a taste for human flesh. She's turned into a zombie in some way. As a result, we get to observe the Hammond family navigating Sheila's new illness over the course of the show's half-hour episodes.</p>

This zombie program is unique in that it is a family comedy at its foundation, but the zombie twist puts it at conflict with that comedic core, giving it a horror edge.</p>

The Walking Dead has captured the raw elemental terror of zombies for ten and a half seasons (with another two and numerous spinoffs to come).</p>

The Walking Dead has seen a lot of cast changes and has gone through a lot of different story arcs. However, zombies have been a constant throughout. They've never looked so iconic, owing to the incredible work of producer, director, and visual effects artist Greg Nicotero.</p>

Liv Moore (get it? ), a Seattle-based medical student, is transformed into a zombie while attending a boat party. She decides to take a job in the morgue as a result of her undead transformation, giving her unrestricted access to brains and allowing her to use her zombie abilities to solve murders. When Liv (and other zombies in this universe) consumes brains, she experiences flashes of the deceased's existence.

All of Us Are Dead is also one of the first major zombie dramas to be released following the outbreak of COVID-19, which includes several long-established narrative tropes reappearing in a new light.\u003c/p\u003e\n                \u003c/div\u003e\n                ","\n                \u003ch2 class=\"ArticleBody_heading__tc5g4\"\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n                "]},"reco":[{"id":"6827305d-b11e-44da-9c7c-3746dc274bca","date":"May 20, 2022","author":"Brian Martin","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52086874610_0c8116f5f8_c.jpg","title":"8 Best Anne Hathaway Movies That You Should Start Watching","tags":"movie news","excerpt":"Few actresses have the variety of Annie, who has appeared in everything from rom-coms to Oscar-winning musicals."},{"id":"f3a18b76-fab6-40a5-946f-b0c36079bb14","date":"May 20, 2022","author":"Brian Martin","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52085954343_8b563cb528_o.png","title":"Quentin Tarantino Discusses How John Carpenter's 'The Thing' Influenced the Making of 'Reservoir Dogs’","tags":"movie news","excerpt":"And why one of the few films that scares him is 'The Thing.’"},{"id":"ea5bcadb-6b70-41d4-aace-29cfb3824434","date":"May 18, 2022","author":"Brian Martin","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52082671695_1bbb5391a0_c.jpg","title":"Where Did 'The Godfather Part IV' Go?
