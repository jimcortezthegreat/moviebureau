                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Johnny Depp admits to never having seen Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl. The first Pirates of the Caribbean film, released in 2003, was a huge smash with audiences and launched a multi-billion-dollar franchise. Captain Jack Sparrow, played by Johnny Depp, was introduced to viewers in Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, a beloved figure who would go on to feature in all four sequels, the most recent of which, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales, was released in 2017.</p>

                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>The possibility of a sixth Pirates of the Caribbean film has been discussed since before the fifth, but no new information has been released about the project in a long time. The production of a sixth Pirates of the Caribbean film might possibly be hampered by Depp's current legal issues. The 58-year-old actor's troubled marriage with ex-wife Amber Heard has long been the topic of tabloid headlines, and the two stars' bitter spat has now moved to the courtroom, with Depp suing Heard for $50 million in defamation.</p>
