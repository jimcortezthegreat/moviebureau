Squid Game was one of Netflix's quickest and most popular releases in recent months, and it was such a smash that the streaming provider swiftly announced plans for a second season. But one of the biggest concerns that fans have about the show is that, aside from the possibility of a lightning in a bottle success, a second season will be without the majority of the ensemble that made the first season so popular.</p>
