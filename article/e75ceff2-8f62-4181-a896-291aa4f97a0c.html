Sae Roy, a formerly jailed young man, now runs an Itaewon restaurant/bar on the straight and narrow. Sae Roy is disappointed when he can't get his business off the ground, since he hopes to use it as a method of avenging himself. Jo Yi Seo from Kim Da Mi comes into his life at the perfect time and completely changes his life. While the romantic aspect of this drama spends the majority of its time in the background, it is still present. As the tale develops, your heart will melt on many levels for Sae Roy, but it will melt in a whole new manner once he finally discovers out what his heart has been trying to tell him for a long time.\u003c/pre\u003e"]},"reco":[{"id":"405cd1ef-56c8-494e-a132-c735b50d2f1c","date":"Apr 12, 2022","author":"Wallace Bell","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51999579280_96c97901cf_c.jpg","title":"Moon Knight Cannot Defeat The Mandalorian In A Fight, According To Pedro Pascal","tags":"tv news","excerpt":"Pedro Pascal joins the argument between Moon Knight and The Mandalorian, which was begun by Moon Knight star Oscar Isaac, and claims that his hero will triumph."},{"id":"062db741-dc24-4805-b849-f08c8a9941db","date":"Apr 11, 2022","author":"Nick Carver","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51997352443_38d85dc031_c.jpg","title":"The Reunion of Doc Ock and Maguire in Spider-Man Made Alfred Molina Cry","tags":"movie news","excerpt":"Alfred Molina, who featured with Tobey Maguire in Spider-Man 2, says that his reunion with Tobey Maguire, who he co-starred with in Spider-Man 2, made him weep."},{"id":"34e061d6-e747-4446-87b6-9e6618fbf51e","date":"Apr 11, 2022","author":"Andres Pineda","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51997523665_55c2a0f398_c.jpg","title":"The Best Filipino Movies That You Need To Watch","tags":"movie news","excerpt":"In this article, we look into Filipino films and cinema, which is undoubtedly one of Southeast Asia's most underrated businesses."},{"id":"6d8df57f-04ce-496f-b891-06c8208020ec","date":"Apr 11, 2022","author":"Wallace Bell","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51997038444_e1d6e422c3_c.jpg","title":"Season 4 Of Stranger Things Is Similar To Game Of Thrones, According To The Creators","tags":"tv news","excerpt":"While discussing Stranger Things season 4, the Duffer Brothers make a comparison between the Netflix series and Game of Thrones."}]},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/article/[id]","query":{"id":"e75ceff2-8f62-4181-a896-291aa4f97a0c"},"buildId":"zraOoJn1bFSoJy9AzAX4-","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
