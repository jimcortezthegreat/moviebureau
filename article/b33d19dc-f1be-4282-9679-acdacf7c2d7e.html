                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Johnny Depp has had a long and diverse career filled with highs and lows, hits and misses, but where does he rank from worst to greatest in terms of movies? Depp began his career as a young idol in films such as A Nightmare on Elm Street and the successful TV program 21 Jump Street, soon progressing to main parts and developing a friendship with director Tim Burton.</p>
                </div>
                 
                <div>
                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Burton is the one who gave him a movie star character that would become distinctly his, a blend of oddball peculiarities and profoundly felt soulfulness. This strange presence would go on to shine in films like Edward Scissorhands and What's Eating Gilbert Grape, eventually culminating to his instantly-iconic role as Captain Jack Sparrow. He's now mired in a dispute after being dismissed from his role as the primary villain in the Fantastic Beasts trilogy by Warner Bros.</p>
                </div>
                 
                <div>
                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Depp's career is broad and varied, brimming with lonesome outcasts, grim-faced criminals, and pounds upon pounds of white makeup, even if his future acting possibilities appear bleak at the moment. Minamata hasn't been included since it was never released in theaters or on Netflix in the United States, according to the filmmaker, who claims MGM sought to bury the picture. City of Lies is also absent, having been withdrawn from its 2018 release date owing to a lawsuit, with no replacement revealed.</p>

                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Johnny Depp could play crime leaders or shady characters in his sleep by this time in his career, and in "Black Mass," he portrays iconic Boston gangster James "Whitey" Bulger under a prosthetic mask.
Whitey Bulger is a nasty figure with practically no redeeming characteristics, and Depp portrays him with such calm malice that it's extremely unsettling to see.</p>

                <div>
                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>After a spate of disappointments that included "The Lone Ranger" and "Mortdecai," Depp's return to form with "Black Mass" proved that he could still put in a superb performance. Most reviewers thought that it was one of his greatest recent portrayals, with the consensus on Rotten Tomatoes claiming that it "spins a captivating yarn out of its fact-based plot — and leaves moviegoers with one of Johnny Depp's most compelling performances in years."</p>

                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>"Minamata," which premiered at the Berlin International Film Festival over two years ago and will be released in the United States in February 2022, feels like it has been on the verge of being released for a long time. Depp portrays W. in the film. Eugene Smith was a real-life war photographer who photographed the consequences of mercury poisoning on the people of Minamata, a coastal Japanese town. Depp's transformation into the persona is practically unrecognizable, showcasing his ability to entirely morph into the character he is portraying.</p>

                <div>
                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>"Minamata" follows a similar theme to investigative documentaries like "Dark Waters," focused on the search to unearth the truth about the possibly life-threatening side-effects of corporate greed on regular people. The picture is patchy at times, but Depp's acting is superbly restrained, and it contributes to the illumination of an essential narrative.</p>

                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Johnny Depp embraces his inner silent cinema star in this quirky 1993 romantic comedy, and it's evident even at this early stage in his career that he was built to play misfits. Depp captures the physicality necessary for the humorous parts in the film as Sam, the love interest of the eponymous Joon (Mary Stuart Masterson), with one notable highlight being his replication of Charlie Chaplin's "bread roll dance" in a diner.</p>

                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>The picture may be a little too bizarre for some, but it is an extraordinary tour de force as an example of what Depp is capable of as an actor. Depp was also nominated for a Golden Globe for best actor in a comedy or musical for his performance.</p>

It also received seven Academy Award nominations, including Depp's second for acting, and one for original soundtrack.</p>

                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>As Victor Van Dort, Depp is almost unrecognizable the stuttering protagonist in Tim Burton's fantastical stop-motion animated film "Corpse Bride." It was Burton's third foray into stop-motion animation, following his contributions to "The Nightmare Before Christmas" and "James And The Giant Peach," but it was the first that he had directed himself.</p>

                <div>
                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>The monotone and dreary "land of the living" contrasts beautifully with the rich color and vibrancy of the "land of the dead," mirroring the differences between Victor and the corpse he accidentally ends up marrying (voiced by Helena Bonham Carter), with the two unexpected partners literally worlds apart. "Corpse Bride" is a charming and ghastly romance that showcases not only Burton's stop-motion skills, but also Depp's voice acting ability.</p>

                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Tim Burton and Johnny Depp are the ideal combo to bring Stephen Sondheim's macabre musical from the Broadway stage to the big screen, based on their track record. "Sweeney Todd" is a slasher film set in the 1800s with singing and practically every phrase set to music. Depp's musical skills prepared him for this role, and his singing voice adds to the demon barber's venom.</p>

Disgruntled moviegoers are said to have taken their complaints to the Advertising Standards Authority. However, those who were able to get into "Sweeney Todd" received rave reviews, and the picture gained critical acclaim as well as an Oscar nomination, with Depp obtaining his third nomination.</p>

While it's a strange little picture, Depp's performance as Axel Blackmar, a young guy with a mind full of visions, is totally enthralling. Axel is coaxed away from New York and back to Arizona for an uncle's wedding, where he has a series of bizarre events, including a crush on the elder Elaine (Faye Dunaway), with whom he helps build a flying contraption.</p>

                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Despite the fact that Johnny Depp's role in Oliver Stone's Vietnam war epic "Platoon" is little, it is crucial. He portrays Lerner, a company interpreter who is assigned to the corporation.

It's also refreshingly honest in portraying Gilbert's conflict; while he is fully dedicated to his brother, he also wishes he could be free of him at times.
While Depp did not earn an Oscar nomination for "What's Eating Gilbert Grape," DiCaprio, who is just 19 years old, received an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor.</p>

                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Johnny Depp, who has been dubbed a "acting chameleon," has the opportunity to voice a real chameleon in the animated film "Rango." When he ends himself in the Old West town of Dirt, he has a lot of fun playing a former pet who is having identity issues. Rango, like the real-life beast, is skilled at weaving narratives to acclimatize himself, posing as a courageous hero whose claims are subsequently put to the test when he is chosen sheriff.</p>

"Rango" affords Depp the opportunity to create a character that feels like it could only be performed by him with just his voice.</p>

"Edward Scissorhands" was the start of a highly lucrative partnership for the two, and it allowed Depp the chance he'd been yearning for to move away from the young heartthrob parts he'd been put in following his breakout appearance on the TV serial "21 Jump Street."</p>

The Telegraph's Marc Lee stated Depp was "sensational in the main character, evoking tension, sorrow, and innocence with tragic sincerity."</p>

Depp's abilities are ideally matched to the role of Wood, who is a colorful and quirky figure. Despite being a box financial disappointment — which seems unusual given the subject matter — "Ed Wood" received great accolades from reviewers and earned two Academy Awards, including best supporting actor for Martin Landau's tragic portrayal as Bela Lugosi.</p>
