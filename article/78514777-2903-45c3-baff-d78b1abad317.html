Marvel Studios is aggressively replenishing the MCU with new heroes and villains in the wake of Avengers: Endgame. Eternals, which debuted around a dozen Eternals as well as Black Knight, Blade, and Harry Styles' Starfox, was a key element of this campaign. Despite the film's negative reviews and poor box office results, several of the characters introduced in Eternals are expected to return.</pre> <pre class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>So yet, no plans for any Eternals cast members to return have been revealed by Marvel Studios. The film teases a few intriguing possibilities, such as Black Knight appearing in Blade, but nothing is certain until Eternals 2 is announced. For what it's worth, Sersi's actress, Gemma Chan, is hopeful that she'll appear in future MCU films. There are also fan-favorite characters like Makkari, Druig, and Thena that fans want to see more of. Now, it appears that one of the Eternals cast members may be returning, although in an unexpected way.</pre>

                </div> <pre class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Based on the information revealed in this rumor, it does help narrow down where Gilgamesh might return, as Lee's return to the United States to concentrate on the production this summer narrows the alternatives. Marvel Studios is ahead of schedule, with all three MCU films set to be released in 2023 currently in production or completed. Blade is set to begin filming in the summer of 2022, which suits Lee's schedule, even if it isn't a natural fit for Gilgamesh. Echo, Ironheart, Armor Wars, and Loki season 2 are among the MCU projects set to film in summer 2022, according to reports. The latter, based on its multiverse concept, might work, but filming is set to take place in the United Kingdom, not America.</pre> <pre class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>There's a chance that, with no clear landing spot for Gilgamesh among the known live-action MCU projects, one is quietly on the way. There's also a tiny chance Lee will join the reshoots for Guardians of the Galaxy 3 or The Marvels, or film a Gilgamesh cameo for Thor: Love and Thunder during late-stage pick-ups. Another possibility for Gilgamesh's return to the MCU is animation, as seen in Marvel's What If...? Season 2 can now use characters from the Eternals. However, Lee would not need to travel to the United States merely to conduct voice work because that can be done remotely. Gilgamesh's MCU return is unknown at this time, however the Eternals character appears to be returning in some form.</pre></div></div><div class="Article_cardContainer__5wwn2 Article_cardLine__jETl3"></div><div class="CardSmall_cardContainer___Oyfj"><div class="CardSmall_cardRow__Vpz6u"><img class="CardSmall_cardImg__rJYhb" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51952772020_5f22a80914_o.png" alt="movie news"/><div><p class="CardSmall_cardTag__NHgUi">movie news</p><a class="CardSmall_cardTitle__nHW3N" href="/article/2e221ef6-4c78-468f-a2fc-868f6d1e6c5a">Gilgamesh from The Eternals, Approves of His MCU Action Figure</a><p class="CardSmall_cardExcerpt__oq5Je">Don Lee, who plays Gilgamesh in Marvel&#x27;s The Eternals, is seen approving of Hot Toys&#x27; action figurines based on his role.</p><p class="CardSmall_cardDate__ifaop">Mar 21, 2022</p></div></div></div><div class="CardSmall_cardContainer___Oyfj"><div class="CardSmall_cardRow__Vpz6u"><img class="CardSmall_cardImg__rJYhb" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51952198698_1c5b6e5d97_o.png" alt="movie news"/><div><p class="CardSmall_cardTag__NHgUi">movie news</p><a class="CardSmall_cardTitle__nHW3N" href="/article/1cb21529-32f3-4d41-b3d5-baad0f19d863">After No Way Home, Marisa Tomei Wants To Reprise Her Role As Aunt May In The Marvel Cinematic Universe</a><p class="CardSmall_cardExcerpt__oq5Je">Following her sad death in last year&#x27;s Spider-Man: No Way Home, Marisa Tomei confesses that she would love to reprise her role as Aunt May.</p><p class="CardSmall_cardDate__ifaop">Mar 21, 2022</p></div></div></div><div class="CardSmall_cardContainer___Oyfj"><div class="CardSmall_cardRow__Vpz6u"><img class="CardSmall_cardImg__rJYhb" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51952077484_727e913025_o.png" alt="tv news"/><div><p class="CardSmall_cardTag__NHgUi">tv news</p><a class="CardSmall_cardTitle__nHW3N" href="/article/7a18b13f-67ef-48a9-8715-35704015c3f8">The Creator Of The Squid Game Reveals Plans To Bring Back Actor in Season 2 After Character Death</a><p class="CardSmall_cardExcerpt__oq5Je">Will there be a second season of Squid Game after it became the surprise Netflix success that blasted through streaming audiences in 2021?</p><p class="CardSmall_cardDate__ifaop">Mar 21, 2022</p></div></div></div><div class="CardSmall_cardContainer___Oyfj"><div class="CardSmall_cardRow__Vpz6u"><img class="CardSmall_cardImg__rJYhb" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51950760392_6ddd24c1ba_o.png" alt="tv news"/><div><p class="CardSmall_cardTag__NHgUi">tv news</p><a class="CardSmall_cardTitle__nHW3N" href="/article/d5921ecd-40e0-4ef2-a840-cb9913c4058f">Season 2 Of Squid Game Will Have More Games, According To The Creator</a><p class="CardSmall_cardExcerpt__oq5Je">Squid Game, Netflix&#x27;s surprise blockbuster, has more lethal activities planned for its players in season 2, according to show creator Hwang Dong-hyuk.</p><p class="CardSmall_cardDate__ifaop">Mar 21, 2022</p></div></div></div><footer class="Footer_footer__ULcHT"><div class="Footer_container__qKZdZ"><div class="Footer_logoContainer__0o6Yh"><img layout="fixed" src="/logo.svg" alt="logo" href="/"/></div><div class="Footer_logoContainer__0o6Yh"><div class="Footer_linkContainer__NJC_u"><a class="Footer_links__WaOvo" href="/">Home</a><a class="Footer_links__WaOvo" href="/about">About</a><a class="Footer_links__WaOvo" href="/privacy">Privacy</a><a class="Footer_links__WaOvo" href="/terms">Terms</a></div></div></div></footer></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"article":{"id":"78514777-2903-45c3-baff-d78b1abad317","date":"Mar 21, 2022","author":"Nick Carver","title":"Actor who played Gilgamesh in the Eternals is said to be returning for a new MCU film or show.","excerpt":"Don Lee, who played Gilgamesh in the Eternals, is rumored to be reprising his role as Gilgamesh in a secret MCU Phase 4 film or series set to begin production this summer.","keywords":"marvel, mcu, eternals, gilgamesh","tags":"movie news","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51952783110_82df08fe6a_o.png","content":["\u003cpre class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'\u003eDon Lee is rumored to be returning for a secret Marvel Cinematic Universe movie or show in Phase 4, which will supposedly involve Eternals' Gilgamesh once more.
