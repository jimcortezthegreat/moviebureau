                <p>"Well, Marvel’s secret sauce is that Kevin likes the films to be entertaining, right? And entertaining typically involves humor, and I think that Kevin’s very big on testing movies and I think he likes to sit in the test screening and hear the response. So the audience’s laughing, you can hear their response. You can understand, ’Okay, every 2 minutes [they] are getting some enjoyment out of the movie,' and that’s a strong way for him to gauge how the movie will perform with an audience, right? So I think humor is very important to him.”</p>

The MCU style of humor has become so popular that it has been imitated by other studios and has now gained a negative reception among some audience members as "Marvel Humor.” Despite the humor, the MCU has been able to incorporate more lofty themes into their films, such as racial politics in Black Panther, colonialism's devastations and effects on refugees in both Captain Marvel and Thor: Ragnarok, and the complicated nature of children and parents in Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings.</pre></div></div><div class="Article_cardContainer__5wwn2 Article_cardLine__jETl3"></div><div class="CardSmall_cardContainer___Oyfj"><div class="CardSmall_cardRow__Vpz6u"><img class="CardSmall_cardImg__rJYhb" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51986899144_f2db0f747f_c.jpg" alt="tv news"/><div><p class="CardSmall_cardTag__NHgUi">tv news</p><a class="CardSmall_cardTitle__nHW3N" href="/article/4485bf95-ab7a-4e8a-ae86-18d24b4bf297">Time-Travel TV Shows That You Must Start Watching</a><p class="CardSmall_cardExcerpt__oq5Je">Time travel is a popular subject in many forms of entertainment, from novels to movies.
