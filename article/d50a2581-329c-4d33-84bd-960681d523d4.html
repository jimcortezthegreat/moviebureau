                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>There have been a number of character fatalities as the Marvel Cinematic Universe has progressed through the Infinity Saga throughout the years. There have been so many deaths in the Marvel Cinematic Universe that it would be hard to mention them all without focusing on the ones that affected us the most.</p>

                <div>
                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Some of these deaths were noticeably more tragic than the others. While a few of these characters have returned in other incarnations, their deaths will go down in history as some of the most heartbreaking events in the MCU.</p>

                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>When Pietro Maximoff, played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson, first emerged as Quicksilver in Avengers: Age of Ultron, fans weren't expecting to spend so little time with the new member of the team. Despite the character's use in the X-Men films being subject to copyright concerns, fans hoped for a bright future for the Maximoff twins on the big screen.</p>

                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Quicksilver, on the other hand, astonished both the audience and Hawkeye when he gave his life to defend the hero and a tiny kid from a shower of gunfire. Wanda continues to play an important role in the MCU after the Infinity Saga, and Hawkeye honors Pietro's sacrifice by naming his little child after him.</p>

                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Rene Russo first played Frigga, Thor and Loki's loving mother, in the 2011 film Thor, and she reprised the character in Thor: The Dark World in 2013. While she gave her sons and even Jane Foster a lot of wisdom, Malekith and his Dark Elves attacked Asgard in pursuit of the Aether, and viewers got to experience Frigga's fighting side.</p>

                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Frigga gave her life in combat against Kurse to allow Jane Foster a chance to flee. Thor and the fans were both deeply affected by Frigga's death. Thor encountered his mother moments before her death in Avengers: Endgame, and this loss was further addressed.</p>

                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Captain America wasn't truly Captain America the first time he was unveiled. He was still skinny Steve Rogers, the Brooklyn thug who never backed down in a fight. Bucky Barnes was constantly by his side back then, and he has been ever since. Bucky, on the other hand, has been there since the beginning, and he and Steve would die before allowing anything to happen to one another.</p>

He was in deep grief for a long period before finally succumbing to his seeming death. Bucky's death was rendered all the more tragic when it was revealed in Captain America: The Winter Soldier that he had been rescued, tortured, and used as a HYDRA weapon for all these years.</p>

                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Howard and Maria Stark had already died by the time the MCU began. However, the particular manner in which the couple perished was not disclosed until Captain America: Civil War. Tony Stark learns that his parents were murdered in this film. Bucky Barnes was used as a weapon against them in 1991.</p>

                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Throughout the MCU, Thor loses a lot of his relatives. His mother, Frigga, was slain in Thor: The Dark World, his brother was killed in Infinity War, and his father, as well as the sister he never knew he had, Hela, was killed in Thor: Ragnarok.</p>

                <div>
                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Thor swiftly discovered that Loki had abandoned Odin on Earth; by the time the brothers tracked to their father, he had died on a grassy rock somewhere in Norway. He said one last goodbye to his boys before passing away, making this moment considerably more poignant than it would have been if he had simply died.</p>

                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>The assassination of Vision has only served to make his death more tragic in retrospect. While Vision began as an artificial intelligence, few would deny that he evolved into a superhero and a human in his own right — albeit a synthetic vibranium android version. Vision realized he could only survive due of the Mind Stone's strength, thus he knew he had to eliminate it.</p>

                <div>
                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Unfortunately, Thanos recognized that in order to get the Soul Stone, he would have to sacrifice the life of someone he genuinely loved – and Gamora was the only one he loved. Gamora had no choice but to die, which was heartbreaking enough. The Guardians learned of her death, and Peter Quill couldn't keep it together, making this one of the saddest MCU deaths.</p>

Loki attempted to fool Thanos by using his trickster abilities, but Thanos just choked him out and killed him in front of his brother. Thor hoped Loki would be able to live this time, but Loki just died.</p>

                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Thanos' snap was one of the most heartbreaking moments in the MCU, leaving fans wondering "who died in Infinity War?" Audiences and characters alike hoped Thanos wouldn't go through with it, but once he had all the Infinity Stones, he did exactly what he had threatened to do: wipe out half of all life in the universe.</p>

                <div>
                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Characters like Bucky Barnes not only died in the arms of their loved ones, but some characters also suffered as a result of their deaths. Because of his Spidey See, Peter Parker could sense it approaching. Spider-Man sobbed in Iron Man's arms as he vanished with half of the franchise's other characters, making the audience weep as well.</p>

                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>With one of the saddest Marvel deaths that startled fans, Spider-Man: No Way Home brought the wall-first crawler's trilogy in the MCU to a close. Aunt May was slain in a confrontation with Norman Osborn/Green Goblin, but she survived long enough to teach Peter a vital and familiar lesson.</p>

                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Fans anticipated that some of the core six Avengers will die in Avengers: Endgame. Tony Stark and Steve Rogers were generally expected to die in this film, bringing their respective MCU journeys to a close. As a result, Natasha Romanoff, popularly known as the Black Widow, was the first of the original six to die, which was all the more stunning.</p>

                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Tony's death at the end of Avengers: Endgame is the saddest death in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It was hypothesized that he and Steve were on their way out in terms of plot, but it's one thing to think and quite another to witness the event unfold in canon before one's eyes. Tony Stark had to do it first to prevent Thanos from snapping — and he got killed in the process.</p>
