The show follows 456 people who enter a competition in the hopes of winning a life-changing sum if they can survive the show's dangerous games. Squid Game's success was recently recognized at this year's award season, with the program winning three SAG awards and a Golden Globe, among other accolades.</pre> <pre class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>While the popularity of Squid Game can be attributed to outstanding storytelling and world-building, the game's major draw is its unusual and horrifying assortment of tournaments. The show depicts harmless games turned deadly, turning childhood favorites like tug of war and even marbles into murderous activities, but Squid Game's most renowned game was its opening event. Red Light Green Light, one of the show's most dangerous games, required participants to halt moving when a terrifying, huge mechanical doll turned around. The doll has also become something of an unofficial Squid Game mascot, with a group of enthusiasts recently attempting to build the robot in real life.</pre>

Despite receiving a warning from the game's leaders, the show's star and single survivor, Seong Gi-hun, set out to end the games once and for all. With Dong-hyuk already organizing his next round of lethal games, it appears that Seong will be involved in more terrifying Squid Game competitions in the future.</pre></div></div><div class="Article_cardContainer__5wwn2 Article_cardLine__jETl3"></div><div class="CardSmall_cardContainer___Oyfj"><div class="CardSmall_cardRow__Vpz6u"><img class="CardSmall_cardImg__rJYhb" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51956013878_29e059cdb5_c.jpg" alt="anime news"/><div><p class="CardSmall_cardTag__NHgUi">anime news</p><a class="CardSmall_cardTitle__nHW3N" href="/article/71995c14-eccf-4eb4-8fee-7425409a94c0">Barcelona Footballer Pays Tribute To Goku From Dragon Ball Z</a><p class="CardSmall_cardExcerpt__oq5Je">During a match against Real Madrid, FC Barcelona footballer Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang shows off his Dragon Ball fandom.</p><p class="CardSmall_cardDate__ifaop">Mar 23, 2022</p></div></div></div><div class="CardSmall_cardContainer___Oyfj"><div class="CardSmall_cardRow__Vpz6u"><img class="CardSmall_cardImg__rJYhb" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51956197919_10291798e9_o.png" alt="movie news"/><div><p class="CardSmall_cardTag__NHgUi">movie news</p><a class="CardSmall_cardTitle__nHW3N" href="/article/c8d944af-1b0d-4791-9664-7109dd706711">&#x27;Drive My Car,&#x27; an Oscar-nominated film by Ryusuke Hamaguchi, has been added to the Criterion Collection</a><p class="CardSmall_cardExcerpt__oq5Je">&#x27;Drive My Car&#x27; is the first Japanese film to receive an Oscar nomination for Best Picture.</p><p class="CardSmall_cardDate__ifaop">Mar 23, 2022</p></div></div></div><div class="CardSmall_cardContainer___Oyfj"><div class="CardSmall_cardRow__Vpz6u"><img class="CardSmall_cardImg__rJYhb" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51955747851_c256e4d768_o.png" alt="tv news"/><div><p class="CardSmall_cardTag__NHgUi">tv news</p><a class="CardSmall_cardTitle__nHW3N" href="/article/77b6029d-1393-4cd6-8d6e-42f72b361c09">The Best Zombie TV Shows That You Should Start Watching</a><p class="CardSmall_cardExcerpt__oq5Je">There are many TV shows featuring zombies, ranging from dramas to post-apocalyptic thrillers and even comedies, but these are the best ones you should start watching.</p><p class="CardSmall_cardDate__ifaop">Mar 23, 2022</p></div></div></div><div class="CardSmall_cardContainer___Oyfj"><div class="CardSmall_cardRow__Vpz6u"><img class="CardSmall_cardImg__rJYhb" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51953436092_93676042cf_o.png" alt="movie news"/><div><p class="CardSmall_cardTag__NHgUi">movie news</p><a class="CardSmall_cardTitle__nHW3N" href="/article/71d9aa6e-276f-4f36-b1b8-79f1ded363d6">Director Says Morbius Has Endless Marvel Crossover Possibilities.</a><p class="CardSmall_cardExcerpt__oq5Je">Exclusive: Director Daniel Espinosa discusses potential future Marvel crossovers as Morbius becomes the latest film in Sony&#x27;s Spider-Man Universe.</p><p class="CardSmall_cardDate__ifaop">Mar 22, 2022</p></div></div></div><footer class="Footer_footer__ULcHT"><div class="Footer_container__qKZdZ"><div class="Footer_logoContainer__0o6Yh"><img layout="fixed" src="/logo.svg" alt="logo" href="/"/></div><div class="Footer_logoContainer__0o6Yh"><div class="Footer_linkContainer__NJC_u"><a class="Footer_links__WaOvo" href="/">Home</a><a class="Footer_links__WaOvo" href="/about">About</a><a class="Footer_links__WaOvo" href="/privacy">Privacy</a><a class="Footer_links__WaOvo" href="/terms">Terms</a></div></div></div></footer></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"article":{"id":"d5921ecd-40e0-4ef2-a840-cb9913c4058f","date":"Mar 21, 2022","author":"Wallace Bell","title":"Season 2 Of Squid Game Will Have More Games, According To The Creator","excerpt":"Squid Game, Netflix's surprise blockbuster, has more lethal activities planned for its players in season 2, according to show creator Hwang Dong-hyuk.","keywords":"squid game, korean, kdrama","tags":"tv news","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51950760392_6ddd24c1ba_o.png","content":["\u003cpre class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'\u003eSeason 2 will have new games, according to Squid Game designer Hwang Dong-hyuk.
