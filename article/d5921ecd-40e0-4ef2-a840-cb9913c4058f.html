The show follows 456 people who enter a competition in the hopes of winning a life-changing sum if they can survive the show's dangerous games. Squid Game's success was recently recognized at this year's award season, with the program winning three SAG awards and a Golden Globe, among other accolades.</pre> <pre class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>While the popularity of Squid Game can be attributed to outstanding storytelling and world-building, the game's major draw is its unusual and horrifying assortment of tournaments. The show depicts harmless games turned deadly, turning childhood favorites like tug of war and even marbles into murderous activities, but Squid Game's most renowned game was its opening event. Red Light Green Light, one of the show's most dangerous games, required participants to halt moving when a terrifying, huge mechanical doll turned around. The doll has also become something of an unofficial Squid Game mascot, with a group of enthusiasts recently attempting to build the robot in real life.</pre>

Dong-hyuk has a plethora of possibilities to make Season 2 as successful as Season 1 with such a vibrant and innovative premise. More Squid Game, on the other hand, appears to be a long way off, which isn't necessarily a bad thing because fans of the program will no doubt want Dong-hyuk to take his time bringing future seasons to life.</pre> <pre class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>After the cliffhanger finish of Season 1, Squid Game could have easily moved away from more games and taken a whole other path. Despite receiving a warning from the game's leaders, the show's star and single survivor, Seong Gi-hun, set out to end the games once and for all. With Dong-hyuk already organizing his next round of lethal games, it appears that Seong will be involved in more terrifying Squid Game competitions in the future.</pre></div></div><div class="Article_cardContainer__5wwn2 Article_cardLine__jETl3"></div><div class="CardSmall_cardContainer___Oyfj"><div class="CardSmall_cardRow__Vpz6u"><img class="CardSmall_cardImg__rJYhb" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51952783110_82df08fe6a_o.png" alt="movie news"/><div><p class="CardSmall_cardTag__NHgUi">movie news</p><a class="CardSmall_cardTitle__nHW3N" href="/article/78514777-2903-45c3-baff-d78b1abad317">Actor who played Gilgamesh in the Eternals is said to be returning for a new MCU film or show.</a><p class="CardSmall_cardExcerpt__oq5Je">Don Lee, who played Gilgamesh in the Eternals, is rumored to be reprising his role as Gilgamesh in a secret MCU Phase 4 film or series set to begin production this summer.</p><p class="CardSmall_cardDate__ifaop">Mar 21, 2022</p></div></div></div><div class="CardSmall_cardContainer___Oyfj"><div class="CardSmall_cardRow__Vpz6u"><img class="CardSmall_cardImg__rJYhb" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51952772020_5f22a80914_o.png" alt="movie news"/><div><p class="CardSmall_cardTag__NHgUi">movie news</p><a class="CardSmall_cardTitle__nHW3N" href="/article/2e221ef6-4c78-468f-a2fc-868f6d1e6c5a">Gilgamesh from The Eternals, Approves of His MCU Action Figure</a><p class="CardSmall_cardExcerpt__oq5Je">Don Lee, who plays Gilgamesh in Marvel&#x27;s The Eternals, is seen approving of Hot Toys&#x27; action figurines based on his role.</p><p class="CardSmall_cardDate__ifaop">Mar 21, 2022</p></div></div></div><div class="CardSmall_cardContainer___Oyfj"><div class="CardSmall_cardRow__Vpz6u"><img class="CardSmall_cardImg__rJYhb" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51952198698_1c5b6e5d97_o.png" alt="movie news"/><div><p class="CardSmall_cardTag__NHgUi">movie news</p><a class="CardSmall_cardTitle__nHW3N" href="/article/1cb21529-32f3-4d41-b3d5-baad0f19d863">After No Way Home, Marisa Tomei Wants To Reprise Her Role As Aunt May In The Marvel Cinematic Universe</a><p class="CardSmall_cardExcerpt__oq5Je">Following her sad death in last year&#x27;s Spider-Man: No Way Home, Marisa Tomei confesses that she would love to reprise her role as Aunt May.</p><p class="CardSmall_cardDate__ifaop">Mar 21, 2022</p></div></div></div><div class="CardSmall_cardContainer___Oyfj"><div class="CardSmall_cardRow__Vpz6u"><img class="CardSmall_cardImg__rJYhb" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51952077484_727e913025_o.png" alt="tv news"/><div><p class="CardSmall_cardTag__NHgUi">tv news</p><a class="CardSmall_cardTitle__nHW3N" href="/article/7a18b13f-67ef-48a9-8715-35704015c3f8">The Creator Of The Squid Game Reveals Plans To Bring Back Actor in Season 2 After Character Death</a><p class="CardSmall_cardExcerpt__oq5Je">Will there be a second season of Squid Game after it became the surprise Netflix success that blasted through streaming audiences in 2021?</p><p class="CardSmall_cardDate__ifaop">Mar 21, 2022</p></div></div></div><footer class="Footer_footer__ULcHT"><div class="Footer_container__qKZdZ"><div class="Footer_logoContainer__0o6Yh"><img layout="fixed" src="/logo.svg" alt="logo" href="/"/></div><div class="Footer_logoContainer__0o6Yh"><div class="Footer_linkContainer__NJC_u"><a class="Footer_links__WaOvo" href="/">Home</a><a class="Footer_links__WaOvo" href="/about">About</a><a class="Footer_links__WaOvo" href="/privacy">Privacy</a><a class="Footer_links__WaOvo" href="/terms">Terms</a></div></div></div></footer></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"article":{"id":"d5921ecd-40e0-4ef2-a840-cb9913c4058f","date":"Mar 21, 2022","author":"Wallace Bell","title":"Season 2 Of Squid Game Will Have More Games, According To The Creator","excerpt":"Squid Game, Netflix's surprise blockbuster, has more lethal activities planned for its players in season 2, according to show creator Hwang Dong-hyuk.","keywords":"squid game, korean, kdrama","tags":"tv news","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51950760392_6ddd24c1ba_o.png","content":["\u003cpre class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'\u003eSeason 2 will have new games, according to Squid Game designer Hwang Dong-hyuk.
