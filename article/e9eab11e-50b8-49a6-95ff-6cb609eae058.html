                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>A videotape of the Peacemaker introduction dance routine being replicated for a high school talent event has prompted director James Gunn to respond. The series, which stars John Cena as the titular hero/antihero, is a direct spinoff from James Gunn's The Suicide Group, and follows the vicious mercenary as he is recruited by Amanda Waller's A.R.G.U.S. to join another black ops squad. They've been tasked with dealing with an extraterrestrial menace in the shape of parasitic butterfly-like organisms who've taken up residence in human bodies.</p>
