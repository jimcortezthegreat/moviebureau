Thanos appears to have succeeded in wiping off half of the galaxy's inhabitants with the use of the Infinity Stones in the 2019 superhero epic, which served as the climax of the first three stages of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the finale of The Infinity Saga. The Avengers' remaining members must get together and craft a time-traveling strategy in the hopes of undoing Thanos' destructive acts and rescuing the Earth once more.</p>

                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Gillan was best recognized for her role as Doctor Who companion Amy Pond a few years before breaking out in Hollywood as Nebula in James Gunn's Guardians of the Galaxy flicks. She first appeared as the character in season 5 of the long-running science fiction series, working alongside Matt Smith's celebrated Eleventh Doctor, before departing in season 7 and returning for the 2013 Christmas special "The Time of the Doctor" to play a role in Smith's departure from the franchise. The Avengers: Endgame sequence Gillan refers to in her humorous regret shows the crew debating different time travel methods and pointing to other media featuring time travel, which could've featured Doctor Who's TARDIS had Gillan been quicker on the gun.</p>
