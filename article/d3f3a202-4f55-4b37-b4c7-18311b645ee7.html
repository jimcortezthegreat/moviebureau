                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Gillan was best recognized for her role as Doctor Who companion Amy Pond a few years before breaking out in Hollywood as Nebula in James Gunn's Guardians of the Galaxy flicks. She first appeared as the character in season 5 of the long-running science fiction series, working alongside Matt Smith's celebrated Eleventh Doctor, before departing in season 7 and returning for the 2013 Christmas special "The Time of the Doctor" to play a role in Smith's departure from the franchise. The Avengers: Endgame sequence Gillan refers to in her humorous regret shows the crew debating different time travel methods and pointing to other media featuring time travel, which could've featured Doctor Who's TARDIS had Gillan been quicker on the gun.</p>
