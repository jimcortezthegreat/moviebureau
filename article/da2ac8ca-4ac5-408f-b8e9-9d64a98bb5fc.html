                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>The venerable basketball animation has returned! Slam Dunk will return in the fall, with creator Takehiko Inoue writing and directing the script. The timing could not be better after such a long gap.</p>

                <div>
                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Slam Dunk premiered as a manga in Weekly Jump in 1990 and ran for six years until being cancelled. It wasn't the first basketball manga, but it was a great phenomenon in Japan, selling over 120 million copies and inspiring a hugely popular anime series that aired from 1993 to 1996, as well as four animated feature films.</p>

                <div>
                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Inoue initially revealed the upcoming film on Twitter in January, as reported by Kotaku at the time.
We now know that everything is on track, and that the picture will be released later next year.</p>

                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>This is a crucial program for anime enthusiasts of a certain generation. Slam Dunk is one of the most influential sports manga and anime of all time. It has a freshness to it, with interesting characters that pique the interest of even non-basketball aficionados. The characters are amusing, and the manga has aided in the further popularization of basketball in Japan, much like Captain Tsubasa did for soccer.</p>

My wife, who was born in Osaka, developed a strong interest in Slam Dunk. She was more interested in the story and characters than in the sport. Any new interest in basketball was a plus for her and others growing up in Japan in the early 1990s.</p>
