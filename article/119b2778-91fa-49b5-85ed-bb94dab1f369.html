                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>While the program featured an ensemble cast of characters with linked stories, Williams' Arya Stark was one of the most popular protagonists, with one of the show's most dramatic arcs. Despite her stubborn spirit, which she shared with the other Stark siblings, she was trained as a Faceless One, which she subsequently used to wreak devastation on her family's adversaries. She became one of the show's most accomplished heroines in Season 8, as she was the one who eventually killed the Night King and defeated the White Walker danger.</p>

Williams, on the other hand, would be open to an Arya comeback provided it made sense for both her career and the Game of Thrones world.</p>

The new series has the advantage of being set a few centuries before the events of its parent program, which means it doesn't have any of the show's narrative baggage and has a genuine chance of recapturing the enchantment that enchanted so many people around the world. Game of Thrones season 8's failure may even work in its advantage, reducing expectations to the point where any amount of success would be welcomed by returning viewers.</p>
