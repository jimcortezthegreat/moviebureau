                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>While the program featured an ensemble cast of characters with linked stories, Williams' Arya Stark was one of the most popular protagonists, with one of the show's most dramatic arcs. Despite her stubborn spirit, which she shared with the other Stark siblings, she was trained as a Faceless One, which she subsequently used to wreak devastation on her family's adversaries. She became one of the show's most accomplished heroines in Season 8, as she was the one who eventually killed the Night King and defeated the White Walker danger.</p>
