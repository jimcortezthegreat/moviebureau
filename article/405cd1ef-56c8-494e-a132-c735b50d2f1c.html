Pascal makes his Star Wars series debut as Din Djarin, a beskar-armored bounty hunter turned parent, in the first season of the show in 2019. The Mandalorian season 3 is on the way following two seasons and a three-episode cameo in The Book of Boba Fett.

Pascal and Isaac have been good friends for a long time and have delighted audiences with their charming bromance. Both have had the opportunity to play major characters in the Star Wars universe, but Isaac's Poe Dameron and Pascal's Din are from separate timelines and have never met. Isaac was the first of the two to make an appearance in Star Wars, and he's now doing the same with Marvel. Isaac was asked whether Moon Knight or Pascal's Mandalorian would win in a battle during an interview to promote the franchise's new series, and he said without doubt that his hero would win.</pre> <pre class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Pascal has now earned the right to react to Isaac's confident assertions. Pascal was informed what Isaac had to say about the showdown between their two idols in an interview with Remezcla after the New York City premiere of his newest film, The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent. "That's so sweet," Pascal answered after a "condescending" chuckle. He wasn't persuaded that Isaac's Moon Knight could physically match up with the Mandalorian, but he did add that Isaac's hero might be able to beat him at Scrabble. Pascal makes it plain that he doesn't accept Isaac's alleged "fact" and is certain that Din would win a fight.</pre>
