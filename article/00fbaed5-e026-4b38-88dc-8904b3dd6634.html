                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>The smash new series From, the spooky invention of Crater's John Griffin, has been renewed by EPIX, MGM's premium satellite and cable network. Set in a secret village that confines everyone who enters — think Lost, which is also produced by series creators Jack Bender and Jeff Pinkner — the show has become one of the network's most popular original programs, with a 94 percent Rotten Tomatoes score. The series has also been well received by audiences, with an overall score of 87 percent based on over one hundred individual ratings.</p>

Fans will undoubtedly be anxious to return to the action as soon as possible, given that the renewal news comes only two weeks after the Season 1 conclusion.</p>
