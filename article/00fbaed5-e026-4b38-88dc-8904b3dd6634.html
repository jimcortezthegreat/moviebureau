                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>The smash new series From, the spooky invention of Crater's John Griffin, has been renewed by EPIX, MGM's premium satellite and cable network. Set in a secret village that confines everyone who enters — think Lost, which is also produced by series creators Jack Bender and Jeff Pinkner — the show has become one of the network's most popular original programs, with a 94 percent Rotten Tomatoes score. The series has also been well received by audiences, with an overall score of 87 percent based on over one hundred individual ratings.</p>

According to the press announcement, filming will begin this summer in Halifax, Nova Scotia, with an air date set for 2023. Fans will undoubtedly be anxious to return to the action as soon as possible, given that the renewal news comes only two weeks after the Season 1 conclusion.</p>
