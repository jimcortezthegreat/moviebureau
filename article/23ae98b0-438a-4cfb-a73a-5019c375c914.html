                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>The 10th anniversary of the debut of Arrow, the superhero TV series that launched one of the most important corners of superhero media history, will be celebrated in October. It is not an exaggeration to say this. Arrow lasted eight seasons and inspired over a half-dozen spinoffs, several of which are still on the air today. Years before its major competition in the shared universe sweepstakes, the MCU, even considered the potential of the multiverse, it addressed the most ambitious comic book plot of all time in real action. It also made Stephen Amell, the starring actor, a star.</p>

As the program was wrapping up its first season back in September 2021, the issue of Arrow came up. While we haven't officially celebrated ten years of Arrow on television, it has been ten years since Amell was cast as Oliver Queen. DC was honoring the 80th anniversary of Green Arrow.</p>
