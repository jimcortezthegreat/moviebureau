                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Have you ever seen an Anne Hathaway film that you didn't enjoy? A quick glance at her resume reveals an excellent mix of rom-coms, love dramas, Christopher Nolan's postmodern cinematic stylings, and a bevy of awards—not to mention, she's the uncontested queen of the onscreen glow up. We reflect on Hathaway's finest work as she returns to our screens in the Apple TV+ series WeCrashed, which focuses on the love story at the core of the growth and demise of the WeWork empire.</p>

Mia already had enough to deal with at high school, but now she has to deal with the reality of being royalty, which include a flood of tabloid interest in her personal life and a handful of phony pals hoping for their own 15 minutes of fame.

Ella, on the other hand, has an unquestioning loyalty that feels more like a curse. As a result, Ella sets off on a mission to find her fairy godmother and break the curse, exhibiting her moral courage and conviction. It's a playful take on the fairy-tale genre, and it gives Hathaway the opportunity to show off her tremendous vocal abilities.</p>

Despite earning a job that "a million females would kill for," Andy isn't one of them, viewing the position as only a stepping stone. Andy physically pulls herself up by her Chanel bootstraps and goes to work after creative director Nigel's scathing speech about her obviously ungrateful attitude, putting her personal connections to the test. You probably don't need us to inform you that this film may be watched indefinitely.</p>

Love and Other Drugs stars Jake Gyllenhaal as the womanizing (really, sort of predatory) pharmaceutical salesperson Jamie in the 1990s, when the erectile dysfunction medicine Viagra had just entered the market. He meets Maggie, a free-spirited young woman, by coincidence (Hathaway). Both insist they aren't seeking for a long-term commitment, but what begins as a casual affair quickly turns into something far more difficult as feelings emerge. When Maggie's medical condition is disclosed, the joyful romantic comedy turns gears, and the two protagonists wonder where their relationship is heading.</p>

Hathaway plays Selina Kyle, a.k.a.

Meanwhile, Bruce Wayne has gone into hiding, only to return when the citizens of Gotham face yet another existential peril.</p>

Princess Mia has graduated from Princeton and arrives in Genovia, ready to begin her royal responsibilities, five years after the first film. Mia is shocked to find, however, that she must marry within a month if she is to become queen in this patriarchal society. When Mia is sabotaged by Nicholas, who is poised to take the throne if Mia fails, chaos ensues.</p>

Love and Other Drugs stars Jake Gyllenhaal as the womanizing (really, sort of predatory) pharmaceutical salesperson Jamie in the 1990s, when the erectile dysfunction medicine Viagra had just entered the market. He meets Maggie, a free-spirited young woman, by coincidence (Hathaway). Both insist they aren't seeking for a long-term commitment, but what begins as a casual affair quickly turns into something far more difficult as feelings emerge.
