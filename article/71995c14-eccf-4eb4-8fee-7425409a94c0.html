Aubameyang went to the field's sidelines after scoring a goal, picked up a transparent orange orb, and placed two fingers on his brow, recreating the pose that Dragon Ball protagonist Son Goku strikes when he uses his Instant Transmission ability, which allows him to teleport great distances in the blink of an eye. "It was a ball from Dragon Ball. With it, you can make a wish. I wanted to win and score a goal for my grandparents, who are gone," the player subsequently stated, confirming that it was a conscious homage to the iconic shonen manga.</pre>

                </div> <pre class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>On his personal Twitter account, Aubameyang later tweeted a photo of himself striking the position with a photo of Goku. "Hello from a finished player," the multi-time Premier League top scorer said, mocking critics who claimed his career was gone after leaving Arsenal. Aubameyang's Twitter profile photo has been changed to a portrait of himself drawn in the style of Akira Toriyama's classic painting. The player is well-known for his eye-catching post-goal celebrations, which frequently include a flip. Aubameyang has also done a "Wakanda Forever" salute while wearing a Black Panther mask and celebrating a victory.</pre> <pre class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Goku is taught the Instant Transmission technique by the friendly people of the planet Yardat after crashing there following his planet-destroying battle with Frieza in the original Dragon Ball manga and the Dragon Ball Z anime. Goku not only exploits his ability to travel throughout the world to surprise opponents, but he has also integrated it into his combat technique, blending it with his famous Kamehameha and Spirit Bomb assaults. The Saiyan warrior most recently employed the technique in the Dragon Ball Super manga's current chapter, where he used it to buy time in his combat with the wish-powered warrior Gas.</pre> <pre class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Toriyama created Dragon Ball in 1984, and it is now the third best-selling manga of all time, with more than 300 million copies in print worldwide. The ongoing Dragon Ball Super manga, which is still overseen by Toriyama himself and incorporates art by his protégé, Toyotarou, continues Goku's exploits to this day.</pre></div></article><div class="Article_cardContainer__5wwn2 Article_cardLine__jETl3"></div><div class="CardSmall_cardContainer___Oyfj"><div class="CardSmall_cardRow__Vpz6u"><img class="CardSmall_cardImg__rJYhb" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51999579280_96c97901cf_c.jpg" alt="tv news"/><div><p class="CardSmall_cardTag__NHgUi">tv news</p><a class="CardSmall_cardTitle__nHW3N" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="/article/405cd1ef-56c8-494e-a132-c735b50d2f1c">Moon Knight Cannot Defeat The Mandalorian In A Fight, According To Pedro Pascal</a><p class="CardSmall_cardExcerpt__oq5Je">Pedro Pascal joins the argument between Moon Knight and The Mandalorian, which was begun by Moon Knight star Oscar Isaac, and claims that his hero will triumph.</p><p class="CardSmall_cardDate__ifaop">Apr 12, 2022</p></div></div></div><div class="CardSmall_cardContainer___Oyfj"><div class="CardSmall_cardRow__Vpz6u"><img class="CardSmall_cardImg__rJYhb" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51997352443_38d85dc031_c.jpg" alt="movie news"/><div><p class="CardSmall_cardTag__NHgUi">movie news</p><a class="CardSmall_cardTitle__nHW3N" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="/article/062db741-dc24-4805-b849-f08c8a9941db">The Reunion of Doc Ock and Maguire in Spider-Man Made Alfred Molina Cry</a><p class="CardSmall_cardExcerpt__oq5Je">Alfred Molina, who featured with Tobey Maguire in Spider-Man 2, says that his reunion with Tobey Maguire, who he co-starred with in Spider-Man 2, made him weep.</p><p class="CardSmall_cardDate__ifaop">Apr 11, 2022</p></div></div></div><div class="CardSmall_cardContainer___Oyfj"><div class="CardSmall_cardRow__Vpz6u"><img class="CardSmall_cardImg__rJYhb" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51997523665_55c2a0f398_c.jpg" alt="movie news"/><div><p class="CardSmall_cardTag__NHgUi">movie news</p><a class="CardSmall_cardTitle__nHW3N" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="/article/34e061d6-e747-4446-87b6-9e6618fbf51e">The Best Filipino Movies That You Need To Watch</a><p class="CardSmall_cardExcerpt__oq5Je">In this article, we look into Filipino films and cinema, which is undoubtedly one of Southeast Asia&#x27;s most underrated businesses.</p><p class="CardSmall_cardDate__ifaop">Apr 11, 2022</p></div></div></div><div class="CardSmall_cardContainer___Oyfj"><div class="CardSmall_cardRow__Vpz6u"><img class="CardSmall_cardImg__rJYhb" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51997038444_e1d6e422c3_c.jpg" alt="tv news"/><div><p class="CardSmall_cardTag__NHgUi">tv news</p><a class="CardSmall_cardTitle__nHW3N" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="/article/6d8df57f-04ce-496f-b891-06c8208020ec">Season 4 Of Stranger Things Is Similar To Game Of Thrones, According To The Creators</a><p class="CardSmall_cardExcerpt__oq5Je">While discussing Stranger Things season 4, the Duffer Brothers make a comparison between the Netflix series and Game of Thrones.</p><p class="CardSmall_cardDate__ifaop">Apr 11, 2022</p></div></div></div><footer class="Footer_footer__ULcHT"><div class="Footer_container__qKZdZ"><div class="Footer_logoContainer__0o6Yh"><img layout="fixed" src="/logo.svg" alt="logo" href="/"/></div><div class="Footer_logoContainer__0o6Yh"><div class="Footer_linkContainer__NJC_u"><a class="Footer_links__WaOvo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="/">Home</a><a class="Footer_links__WaOvo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="/about">About</a><a class="Footer_links__WaOvo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="/contact">Contact</a><a class="Footer_links__WaOvo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="/privacy">Privacy</a><a class="Footer_links__WaOvo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="/terms">Terms</a></div></div></div></footer></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"article":{"id":"71995c14-eccf-4eb4-8fee-7425409a94c0","date":"Mar 23, 2022","author":"Kohei Watanabe","title":"Barcelona Footballer Pays Tribute To Goku From Dragon Ball Z","excerpt":"During a match against Real Madrid, FC Barcelona footballer Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang shows off his Dragon Ball fandom.","keywords":"anime, dragonball, goku, kakarot","tags":"anime news","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51956013878_29e059cdb5_c.jpg","content":["\u003cpre class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'\u003ePierre-Emerick Aubameyang, a professional footballer, celebrated a goal with a posture that Dragon Ball fans will recognize.\u003c/pre\u003e","\u003cpre class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'\u003eAccording to SB Nation, Aubameyang paid tribute to Akira Toriyama's popular anime and manga genre during FC Barcelona's last match against Real Madrid, which Barcelona won 4-0.
