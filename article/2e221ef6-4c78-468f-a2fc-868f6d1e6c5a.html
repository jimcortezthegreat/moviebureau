In Chloé Zhao's 2022 Marvel epic, the actor played the immortal hero.

When Thena (Jolie) develops Mahd Wy'ry and inadvertently assaults her fellow Eternals, Gilgamesh exiles her so that her condition does not endanger the team and he can care for her in a more secure environment. While Gilgamesh's function changed from previous drafts, his and Thena's friendship became one of the Eternals' most well-known features, making them likeable characters. Many fans, including Lee himself, were ecstatic to see the character depicted on products, as he disclosed in a recent post.</pre>
