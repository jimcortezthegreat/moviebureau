Alex Kurtzman has called his 2017 directorial effort "The Mummy" the "biggest failure of my life, both personally and professionally." The Mummy received widespread acclaim from reviewers and made $410 million worldwide, ultimately putting the studio's franchise dreams to rest.</p>

I am very grateful for the opportunity to make those mistakes because it rebuilt me into a tougher person, and it also rebuilt me into a clearer filmmaker. That has been a real gift, and I feel those gifts all the time because I’m very clear now when I have a feeling that doesn’t feel right,” Kurtzman added. “I am not quiet about it anymore. I will literally not proceed when I feel that feeling. It’s not worth it to me. And you can’t get to that place of gratitude until you’ve had that kind of experience.”</p>

After "The Mummy" flopped with reviewers and at the box office, none of these films were developed. Cruise bounced back a year later with "Mission: Impossible – Fallout," which grossed $791 million worldwide and became the highest-grossing "Mission" film to date.</p>
