Alex Kurtzman has called his 2017 directorial effort "The Mummy" the "biggest failure of my life, both personally and professionally." The Mummy received widespread acclaim from reviewers and made $410 million worldwide, ultimately putting the studio's franchise dreams to rest.</p>

That has been a real gift, and I feel those gifts all the time because I’m very clear now when I have a feeling that doesn’t feel right,” Kurtzman added. “I am not quiet about it anymore.

After "The Mummy" flopped with reviewers and at the box office, none of these films were developed. Cruise bounced back a year later with "Mission: Impossible – Fallout," which grossed $791 million worldwide and became the highest-grossing "Mission" film to date.</p>
