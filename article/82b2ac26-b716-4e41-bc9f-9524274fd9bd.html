Alex Kurtzman has called his 2017 directorial effort "The Mummy" the "biggest failure of my life, both personally and professionally." The Mummy received widespread acclaim from reviewers and made $410 million worldwide, ultimately putting the studio's franchise dreams to rest.</p>

Cruise bounced back a year later with "Mission: Impossible – Fallout," which grossed $791 million worldwide and became the highest-grossing "Mission" film to date.</p>
