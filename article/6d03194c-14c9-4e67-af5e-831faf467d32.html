                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>If the perfect job came along, Zac Efron says he would leap at the chance to join the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Efron's career was launched with his portrayal as Troy Bolton in the famous Disney Channel original High School Musical.

Given the MCU's unmatched profit margins and certified-fresh track record on Rotten Tomatoes, just about everyone in Hollywood would at least contemplate joining its world. Efron has recently become a favorite fan cast for characters like as Nova, Adam Warlock, and the Human Torch, and it appears that he'd want to play a superhero/villain in the MCU.</p>
