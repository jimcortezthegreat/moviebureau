                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Time travel is a gimmick that will never go out of style. Humans are fascinated by the prospect of traveling back in time, exploring the future, and discovering a new present. Any media that includes time travel allows us to fantasize about what may have been. The new Disney+ spin-off Loki returns to this topic, but the program does not go as far as one might imagine in terms of time travel.</p>

                <div>
                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>The critically acclaimed 1995 film 12 Monkeys is still regarded as a science-fiction masterpiece today, so a television version was an unexpected decision. However, in 2015, Syfy aired a reboot of the series, and while it didn't get universal acclaim like its predecessor, 12 Monkeys is captivating from beginning to end. Katarina Jones (Barbara Sukowa) sends time traveler James Cole (Aaron Stanford) back in time to retrieve Dr. Cassandra Railly (Amanda Schull), who may be able to halt a future pandemic from spreading. As they are pursued by a strange gang known as the Army of the 12 Monkeys, they forge an odd alliance. Along the road, the two make allies and foes who will aid and obstruct their objective.</p>

                <div>
                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Doctor Who, which airs on BBC One in the United Kingdom, follows Time Lord aka The Doctor and his companions as they travel across time to prevent evil forces from altering history and harming innocent people.</p>

                <div>

                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Kiera Cameron (Rachel Nichols) is a police officer from the future who is stuck in the present in Continuum. When she meets a juvenile prodigy, the two form an unexpected alliance that will aid them in stopping vicious assassins who have traveled from the future to the past. Continuum could have easily slipped into the same tired police procedural cliches we've seen a million times before. However, the future setting and a diverse cast of characters and relationships made this show stand out. Kiera is an intriguing protagonist. She's excellent at her work, but she's also a person who has outlived her usefulness. She's working on cases at the same time, unable to accomplish the one thing she really wants to do: return to her own time and life.</p>
                </div>
                 
                <div>
                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>As the series progresses, Kiera's trusted tech companion, Alec (Erik Knudsen), has surprise plot arcs. Carlos Fonnegra (Victor Webster), Kiera's fellow detective, is significantly more complex than one might think. Carlos is first thrilled to have a capable companion like Kiera, but he soon becomes suspicious when Kiera appears to be too good to be true. In this program, the villains are equally as interesting as the protagonists, capable of foiling Kiera's plans while still having their own stories to tell. Continuum, which stars a who's who of Canadian performers, is one of the few episodes to be filmed and set in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, which helped it become a popular with Canadian fans.</p>

                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>NBC's Timeless is another time travel TV show that has already become a cult classic and is appreciated by people all around the world. And, despite the drama that has surrounded this program, it is still time travel at its finest. Timeless, starring Malcolm Barrett, Matt Lanter, and Abigail Spencer as Rufus, Wyatt, and Lucy, follows the three as they journey across time to stop their enemies from changing history.</p>

                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>But, as it turns out, the conspiracy is more complicated than simply altering history. Our trio is hunting people who are going through time to bring down a terrifying and all-powerful organization. The same one that assisted in the construction of Rufus, Wyatt, and Lucy's time machine. Even though Timeless only lasted two seasons (plus a two-hour finale film), you should still see it since it's not only entertaining but also makes you think and desire to learn more about the events depicted in each episode.</p>

                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Netflix's Dark is for you if you're seeking for a mind-bending, jaw-dropping show. This critically regarded German production is a mix of science fiction and horror. The drama takes place in the little village of Winden and follows numerous families who are all tied in some manner. The plot of the play begins when an apparently content husband and father commits suicide. His son, Jonas Kahnwald (Louis Hofmann), gets dragged into a wormhole and transported to other periods – and subsequently, alternate universes – where he learns the truth about his hometown and personal past. Dark is a captivating television show. You'll never know what's going to happen next.</p>

                <div>
                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>This is suspenseful television at its finest, and one of Netflix's best original programs to date. The casting on this program is fantastic — the plot spans generations, and some of the actors picked to represent the younger and older versions of the characters are so similar in appearance that it's difficult to believe they're not related in real life. The show's biggest value is once again the characters. Some you'll want to defend, while others you'll immediately despise. The show ended after three seasons, so you won't have to deal with any cliffhangers if you watch it all at once.</p>

                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Want to see another show that successfully blends time travel and historical events? Then you should add Outlander to your list of must-see TV shows! The story begins in the 1940s, when Claire Randall, a battlefield nurse, travels to Inverness, Scotland on her second honeymoon with her husband Frank. Claire comes across the standing stones of Craigh na Dun by chance, and they transfer her to 1743.</p>

And she accomplishes this by joining a band of Clan MacKenzie rebels and marrying one of them, Jamie Fraser. However, she soon falls in love with her new spouse and helps the clan elude the British redcoats who are chasing them. Claire jumps back and forth between the 20th and 18th centuries and her two families as she encounters two pregnancies, wars, and much more throughout the five seasons of Outlander that are now available (with the sixth coming shortly). Claire, on the other hand, finally finds her way back to Jamie.</p>

                <div>
                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Kei Sanbe's manga series Erased is written and illustrated in Japanese. Netflix converted the series into a live-action show, with an anime adaptation also available. As a result, this is a two-for-one entry. Satoru Fujinuma, who possesses the power to go into his past, is the protagonist of Erased. When tragedy strikes, Satoru must travel back in time to prevent the murders and kidnappings of his classmates. The anime and live-action productions are both fascinating to watch. The characters are just ordinary individuals trying to right their wrongs, which is what makes them so intriguing to watch. Noriko Eguchi, who portrays the mother in the live-action production, does a fantastic job in the part.</p>
                </div>
                 
                <div>
                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>The major murder mystery will have you on the edge of your seat, especially the historical tale, when the protagonists are all youngsters attempting to keep each other safe. The Japanese setting is also a nice change of pace from most other programs. Because the series is character-driven, you get a sense of what it would be like to live with these folks. The event also includes non-sushi Japanese food, which is fantastic to behold. The series might have easily been adapted for several seasons, but the showrunners stayed true to the original manga's plot and completed the arc in one season.</p>

                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>A mysterious individual gathers a group of heroes, stating that they are "legends" who must preserve the chronology. DC's Legends of Tomorrow is a spin-off from a number of CWVerse series. This program, unlike the others in the CWVerse, isn't explicitly based on a comic book series, but it does feature some comic book characters as members of the team. The program took a while to find its foothold, and by the conclusion of the first season, some of the primary cast members had gone. However, DC's Legends of Tomorrow has regained its stride since then. With a cast of people that are both irreverent and devoted, the program is at ease being quirky and campy.</p>
                </div>
                 
                <div>
                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>They are the quintessential heroes — in other words, total catastrophes who sabotage every operation they undertake yet manage to solve it in the end. The show is known for its varied cast (which has gotten better with each season), gay themes, and the endearing primary relationship between co-captains Sara Lance (Caity Lotz) and Ava Sharpe (Sarah Paulson) (Jess Macallan). There's also a lot of time travel involved. In practically every episode, the squad travels across time, and they must dress appropriately if they are going off-ship. The Legends know how to look nice while fighting bad guys, whether they're humans, gods, or aliens.</p>

Noriko Eguchi, who portrays the mother in the live-action production, does a fantastic job in the part.\u003c/p\u003e\n                \u003c/div\u003e\n                ","\n                \u003cdiv\u003e\n                \u003cp class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'\u003eThe major murder mystery will have you on the edge of your seat, especially the historical tale, when the protagonists are all youngsters attempting to keep each other safe. The Japanese setting is also a nice change of pace from most other programs. Because the series is character-driven, you get a sense of what it would be like to live with these folks. The event also includes non-sushi Japanese food, which is fantastic to behold. The series might have easily been adapted for several seasons, but the showrunners stayed true to the original manga's plot and completed the arc in one season.\u003c/p\u003e\n                \u003c/div\u003e\n                ","\n                \u003ch2 class=\"ArticleBody_heading__tc5g4\"\u003eThe Umbrella Academy\u003c/h2\u003e\n                ","\n                \u003cdiv class='ArticleBody_imageContainer__ktXae'\u003e\n                \u003cimg src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51987146480_e1ca40b032_k.jpg\" alt=\"series, tv shows, time travel\"\u003e\n                \u003c/div\u003e","\n                \u003cdiv\u003e\n                \u003cp class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'\u003eThe Umbrella Academy, a Netflix original, adds to the list.

DC's Legends of Tomorrow is a spin-off from a number of CWVerse series. This program, unlike the others in the CWVerse, isn't explicitly based on a comic book series, but it does feature some comic book characters as members of the team. The program took a while to find its foothold, and by the conclusion of the first season, some of the primary cast members had gone. However, DC's Legends of Tomorrow has regained its stride since then. With a cast of people that are both irreverent and devoted, the program is at ease being quirky and campy.\u003c/p\u003e\n                \u003c/div\u003e\n                ","\n                \u003cdiv\u003e\n                \u003cp class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'\u003eThey are the quintessential heroes — in other words, total catastrophes who sabotage every operation they undertake yet manage to solve it in the end. The show is known for its varied cast (which has gotten better with each season), gay themes, and the endearing primary relationship between co-captains Sara Lance (Caity Lotz) and Ava Sharpe (Sarah Paulson) (Jess Macallan). There's also a lot of time travel involved. In practically every episode, the squad travels across time, and they must dress appropriately if they are going off-ship. The Legends know how to look nice while fighting bad guys, whether they're humans, gods, or aliens.\u003c/p\u003e\n                \u003c/div\u003e\n                ","\n                \u003ch2 class=\"ArticleBody_heading__tc5g4\"\u003eFringe\u003c/h2\u003e\n                ","\n                \u003cdiv class='ArticleBody_imageContainer__ktXae'\u003e\n                \u003cimg src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51986881054_4c58e8f146.jpg\" alt=\"series, tv shows, time travel\"\u003e\n                \u003c/div\u003e","\n                \u003cdiv\u003e\n                \u003cp class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'\u003eParallel worlds, superhuman talents, bioengineering, apocalypse prophesies, and, of course, time travel all featured prominently in Fox's Fringe series.
