                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>It's bordering on cliché to write it now, but it's true: Steven Soderbergh is the maestro of crafting great films in any genre. Soderbergh tackled a sports picture with High Flying Bird after experimenting with horror, stripper humor, and a slew of other genres. But this isn't the narrative you're expecting to hear. The uber-uber-dramatic life of a modern-day sports agent is chronicled in High Flying Bird. High Flying Bird is one of the most true-to-life sports documentaries you'll ever see, thanks to NBA player appearances and André Holland's outstanding performance.</p>

                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>In Celtic Pride, the 1996 comedy co-written by Judd Apatow and Colin Quinn about a pair of Boston die-hards who revere their teams above all else, it's easy to mistake Daniel Stern for a younger Bill Simmons. Mike (Stern) and Jimmy (Dan Akroyd) are desperate for the Celtics to win the Jazz in Game 7 of the NBA Finals, so they intoxicate and abduct Utah's best player, Lewis Scott (Damon Wayans), which has far-reaching consequences. It's a skit in quest of a movie, but it does include Christopher McDonald at his finest as Utah's temperamental coach—at his Happy Gilmore height.</p>

                <div>
                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Blue Chips is a brilliant depiction of collegiate basketball's faults and ugliness. Coach Pete Bell (played by Nick Nolte) is an old-school football coach who despises the unlawful "booster activities" that take on behind the scenes. As a consequence, he kept his program extremely clean and kept all boosters away from his athletes. As his formerly famed program began to falter, an internal conflict arose between his personal ethics and the temptation of winning at any costs.</p>
                </div>
                 
                <div>
                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Bell's own principles were eventually compromised, and he caved in to the unscrupulous "friends of the program." In effect, he became the very thing he despised: an unfaithful and deceitful coach who succumbed to temptations and strayed from his own morals. In my opinion, this is a really undervalued film that correctly depicts the various forces that may have an affect on a collegiate athletics team. Former NBA stars Penny Hardaway and Shaquille O'Neal played two of Coach Bell's players in the film.</p>

                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Like Mike, which won an award for having the most NBA cameos in a single film, tells the fantastical story of Calvin Cambridge (Lil' Bow Wow), an orphan who laces up some old sneakers with the faded initials "MJ" and instantly elevates his ball skills to superstar levels, prompting the fictional Los Angeles Knights to sign him. Until Cambridge waxes the floor with perennial All-Stars, this appears to be a marketing trick. In his much-taller teammate (played by Morris Chestnut), he finds the father figure he's always sought, giving this brand-infused, career trampoline situation just enough emotional gravity.</p>

He finally takes advantage of the situation by rushing down the floor and ending with a slam dunk, turning the shocked surprise into a joyous surprise. Finally, this youngster is able to play! Teen Wolf, as his classmates refer to him, grows up to be a great athlete, ball hog, and small star who tries to control his hair-growing, eye-glowing tendencies. Even if the rationale is absurd, Fox has enough charisma to pull it off—even on a full moon.</p>

                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>It's evident from the moment Leonardo DiCaprio begins to dribble that he can't genuinely play basketball. However, in The Basketball Diaries, based on poet Jim Carroll's memoir of the same name, this judgment is irrelevant. Carroll's stardom as a member of New York City's "hottest Catholic High School basketball team" fades swiftly and brilliantly as he is sexually molested by his coach and falls into a deadly drug addiction. It's a depressing portrayal of athletic potential squandered. Basketball, rather than giving a route out, provides a glimpse of what may have been.</p>

It's the mid-1960s, and things are changing at Texas Western University, where Don Haskins (Josh Lucas) is hired to run the basketball program. He fills his group with seven black guys who have little chance of attending college due to a lack of recruiting help. Throughout the Miners' virtually perfect season, they face a barrage of anti-integration sentiment, which reaches a head in the National Championship game when Haskins makes history by playing five African-American players. In this professionally produced retrospective, nothing shocks, and nothing truly disappoints.</p>

She transforms a brilliant but dysfunctional squad into a generally polished product, connecting with—and bailing out—the team's lovesick point guard (Fredro Starr) and straightening out a drugged-up Terrance Howard throughout the course of the project. The basketball sequences are badly edited, interrupting the flow of an otherwise cliché-ridden, successful season. Try to take pleasure in the small things, like Perlman learning and then teaching a 3-2 zone.</p>

                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Above the Rim, a film that takes its title extremely literally, makes it practically hard to keep track of how many dunks occur. Kyle (Duane Martin), a high school hotshot, adopts a style of street ball that is diametrically opposed to the manner his head coach and college scouts want him to play. Kyle, a glorified ball hog, gets too involved with a Harlem drug dealer (the evil Tupac Shakur), whose elder brother (Leon), a former high school standout who is now a security officer, begins dating Kyle's mother. The performances, which include cameos from Marlon Wayans and Bernie Mac, add to an unexpected playground tournament climax that is both magnificent and terrifying.</p>

                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Space Jam is a fun film, but its immense success has more to do with cultural iconography than with cinematic merit. Michael Jordan was unrivaled in the 1990s, and his retirement shocked not only the basketball world, but the greater American psyche as well. Jordan's retirement, baseball stint, and return to NBA glory gave a chance for Space Jam to leverage on a preexisting tale that would interact directly with the culture of the time, whether due to the loss of his father or false reports of gambling debts. The script lets viewers to create their own story about Jordan's turbulent years away from the game.</p>

As Hickory's new basketball coach, Norman Dale (Gene Hackman) ruffles feathers by imparting the principles of the game. Jimmy Chitwood, the best player in the small farm town, initially refuses to play but eventually joins the team as long as Dale stays, and the seven-man unit surges towards its championship goals. The Hoosiers established the standard for the traditional motivating speech—if you play hard, you'll win no matter what the scoreboard says—followed by a locker room power clap that can be seen on video boards at every major sports stadium. Among its numerous innovations, the film redefined the use of measuring tape within enormous venues.</p>
