Joe and his brother Anthony first appeared in the MCU in Phase 2 with Captain America: The Winter Soldier, a political thriller.

The characters are now both departed from the franchise, despite the fact that their individual stories in Avengers: Endgame ended differently. To slay the Mad Titan, Iron Man sacrificed his life. Captain America, meanwhile, was given a second chance at life when he traveled back in time to meet Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell) in the 1940s.</pre> <pre class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>When asked how the Russos, along with writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, came to this conclusion, Joe explained that it all comes down to what they believe would be a more interesting story.

                <p>”If you think of Captain America as a character, you go 'Okay, Captain America dying is fairly obvious,' right? That is, you know, something he would do based on the character. You know, this is a guy who, you know, offered to be a guinea pig in a science experiment. He's intrinsically a hero. Like there's not a lot of complexity there. It might be emotionally impactful because you like him. You know he's a very likable character, but that's not necessarily the most compelling arc. Tony Stark is a character who was supposed to die. If you watch Iron Man, the first five minutes of that film, he should have died, but he didn't, he got captured and he has an ego, right? And that first movie's about the subjugation of his ego in order for him to be a hero. But that ego then fuels him, and at times it competes with this idea of him being a hero. That seems like a more interesting arc to us to take a character who had an ego because to die for others, you have to defeat the rights of that. It seemed like the more compelling arc to us that it would be Stark who died. So that it would be a richer more complex arc, and that's why we chose him.”</p>

While his death was terrible, especially because he left behind his wife Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) and their little daughter Morgan (Lexi Rabe), his sacrifice serves his personal arc in the long run.
