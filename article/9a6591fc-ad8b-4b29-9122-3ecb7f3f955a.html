                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>The Red Shoes is a South Korean horror film that draws inspiration from the same-named story by Hans Christian Andersen, published in 1845. In the movie, a young woman named Sun-Jae (Kim Hye-Su), who had recently ended her marriage, picks up a pair of cursed red shoes at the railway station and brings ill luck to everyone around her.</p>

                <div>
                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Gonjiam: Haunted Asylum, while adhering to the now-familiar and frequently-used found-footage style, does so in a very novel way, with believable dialogue in the form of character banter and behind-the-scenes jokes, and a pacing that, while effective in setting up the story, cannot adequately prepare its audience for the utter terror that it soon starts to deliver.</p>

Park Chan-interpretation wook's of the vampire genre is a rough version of Zola's Thérèse Raquin and shares a lot in common with the current Netflix series Midnight Mass.

                <div>
                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>It's a strange movie, The Wailing. It's excessively long for a horror film at 156 minutes, but for good reason. After all, what starts out as a police procedural quickly transforms into a ghost story and a zombie film with demonic possessions and small-town dread, frightening youngsters, violent family members, paranoia, superstition, shamanism, and other weird things. The Wailing keeps you on your toes right up to the heartbreaking closing seconds despite the fact that there is a lot going on. It is also surprisingly tonally consistent and very unnerving.</p>
                </div>
                 
                <div>
                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>In the movie, a mysterious Japanese visitor enters a small South Korean community. Villagers soon after his arrival begin exhibiting weird infection-related symptoms that finally force them to murder their families. Cops looking into one of these murder cases encounter a strange lady who claims the stranger is to blame for the epidemic. Before his daughter becomes the next victim, one of the officers must unravel the mystery after discovering a piece of his daughter's property at the stranger's home. Strange, unsettling, and sending you down a rabbit hole, this original horror film deserves all the praise it received when it was first released.</p>

The lavish, seductive, and passionate epic Thirst is laced with the dark humor of filmmaker Park. It's stunning, gruesome, and somewhat heartbreaking; for aficionados of vampires, a must-see.\u003c/p\u003e\n                \u003c/div\u003e\n                ","\n                \u003ch2 class=\"ArticleBody_heading__tc5g4\"\u003eThe Wailing (2016)\u003c/h2\u003e\n                ","\n                \u003cdiv class='ArticleBody_imageContainer__ktXae'\u003e\n                \u003cimg src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52226697460_1b9b2174a4_b.jpg\" alt=\"Korean horror movies \"\u003e\n                \u003c/div\u003e","\n                \u003cdiv\u003e\n                \u003cp class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'\u003eIt's a strange movie, The Wailing. It's excessively long for a horror film at 156 minutes, but for good reason. After all, what starts out as a police procedural quickly transforms into a ghost story and a zombie film with demonic possessions and small-town dread, frightening youngsters, violent family members, paranoia, superstition, shamanism, and other weird things. The Wailing keeps you on your toes right up to the heartbreaking closing seconds despite the fact that there is a lot going on. It is also surprisingly tonally consistent and very unnerving.\u003c/p\u003e\n                \u003c/div\u003e\n                ","\n                \u003cdiv\u003e\n                \u003cp class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'\u003eIn the movie, a mysterious Japanese visitor enters a small South Korean community. Villagers soon after his arrival begin exhibiting weird infection-related symptoms that finally force them to murder their families. Cops looking into one of these murder cases encounter a strange lady who claims the stranger is to blame for the epidemic. Before his daughter becomes the next victim, one of the officers must unravel the mystery after discovering a piece of his daughter's property at the stranger's home. Strange, unsettling, and sending you down a rabbit hole, this original horror film deserves all the praise it received when it was first released.\u003c/p\u003e\n                \u003c/div\u003e\n                "]},"reco":[{"id":"7ae9d477-fc9f-404d-a04c-775138154a2c","date":"Aug 26, 2022","author":"Brian Martin","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52312214911_60f6983b77_o.png","title":"10 Best Tom Holland Movies That You Should Watch","tags":"movie news","excerpt":"Over the years, Tom Holland has acted in a variety of unusual productions, from modest family dramas to one of the most successful superhero franchises ever."},{"id":"20f21369-01e5-4314-ba58-8357fd692e7a","date":"Aug 22, 2022","author":"Brian Martin","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52302597816_9d2b77723c_o.png","title":"The Heirs of the Dragon: House Of The Dragon Episode 1 Review","tags":"tv news","excerpt":"The first episode of the television series \"House of the Dragon\" features plenty of dragon blood."},{"id":"6006b928-df17-4339-83be-48c556f130b6","date":"Aug 17, 2022","author":"Brian Martin","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52291503484_5255d8337d_o.png","title":"Netflix And Chill With Park Seo-joon: Here Are All His Shows And Movies That You Can Watch On Netflix!","tags":"movie news","excerpt":"The romantic comedy king of Korea has arrived"},{"id":"784fda23-c9d9-41ee-b563-d84cd7ceb0b6","date":"Aug 15, 2022","author":"Brian Martin","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52287305098_e1a05b3c74_o.png","title":"Park Seo Jun discusses his involvement with the MCU, his relationships with BTS’s V and the rest of the “Wooga Squad,” and the social and economic themes that influenced his TV successes Itaewon Class","tags":"movie news","excerpt":"Park Seo Jun: ‘I actually couldn’t believe Marvel wanted to speak to me’"}]},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/article/[id]","query":{"id":"9a6591fc-ad8b-4b29-9122-3ecb7f3f955a"},"buildId":"kkqV9dd9pa08-IDTd0bkC","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
