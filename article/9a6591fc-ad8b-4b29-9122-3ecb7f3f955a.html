International horror movies might be among the scariest. Although social horror hit Squid Game has recently made headlines in Korean pop culture, the nation's film has been expertly frightening us for decades.

                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>The Red Shoes is a South Korean horror film that draws inspiration from the same-named story by Hans Christian Andersen, published in 1845. In the movie, a young woman named Sun-Jae (Kim Hye-Su), who had recently ended her marriage, picks up a pair of cursed red shoes at the railway station and brings ill luck to everyone around her.</p>

                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Gonjiam: Haunted Asylum, while adhering to the now-familiar and frequently-used found-footage style, does so in a very novel way, with believable dialogue in the form of character banter and behind-the-scenes jokes, and a pacing that, while effective in setting up the story, cannot adequately prepare its audience for the utter terror that it soon starts to deliver.</p>

Park Chan-interpretation wook's of the vampire genre is a rough version of Zola's Thérèse Raquin and shares a lot in common with the current Netflix series Midnight Mass.

                <div>
                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>It's a strange movie, The Wailing. It's excessively long for a horror film at 156 minutes, but for good reason. After all, what starts out as a police procedural quickly transforms into a ghost story and a zombie film with demonic possessions and small-town dread, frightening youngsters, violent family members, paranoia, superstition, shamanism, and other weird things. The Wailing keeps you on your toes right up to the heartbreaking closing seconds despite the fact that there is a lot going on. It is also surprisingly tonally consistent and very unnerving.</p>
                </div>
                 
                <div>
                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>In the movie, a mysterious Japanese visitor enters a small South Korean community. Villagers soon after his arrival begin exhibiting weird infection-related symptoms that finally force them to murder their families. Cops looking into one of these murder cases encounter a strange lady who claims the stranger is to blame for the epidemic. Before his daughter becomes the next victim, one of the officers must unravel the mystery after discovering a piece of his daughter's property at the stranger's home. Strange, unsettling, and sending you down a rabbit hole, this original horror film deserves all the praise it received when it was first released.</p>

The lavish, seductive, and passionate epic Thirst is laced with the dark humor of filmmaker Park. It's stunning, gruesome, and somewhat heartbreaking; for aficionados of vampires, a must-see.\u003c/p\u003e\n                \u003c/div\u003e\n                ","\n                \u003ch2 class=\"ArticleBody_heading__tc5g4\"\u003eThe Wailing (2016)\u003c/h2\u003e\n                ","\n                \u003cdiv class='ArticleBody_imageContainer__ktXae'\u003e\n                \u003cimg src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52226697460_1b9b2174a4_b.jpg\" alt=\"Korean horror movies \"\u003e\n                \u003c/div\u003e","\n                \u003cdiv\u003e\n                \u003cp class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'\u003eIt's a strange movie, The Wailing. It's excessively long for a horror film at 156 minutes, but for good reason. After all, what starts out as a police procedural quickly transforms into a ghost story and a zombie film with demonic possessions and small-town dread, frightening youngsters, violent family members, paranoia, superstition, shamanism, and other weird things. The Wailing keeps you on your toes right up to the heartbreaking closing seconds despite the fact that there is a lot going on. It is also surprisingly tonally consistent and very unnerving.\u003c/p\u003e\n                \u003c/div\u003e\n                ","\n                \u003cdiv\u003e\n                \u003cp class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'\u003eIn the movie, a mysterious Japanese visitor enters a small South Korean community. Villagers soon after his arrival begin exhibiting weird infection-related symptoms that finally force them to murder their families. Cops looking into one of these murder cases encounter a strange lady who claims the stranger is to blame for the epidemic. Before his daughter becomes the next victim, one of the officers must unravel the mystery after discovering a piece of his daughter's property at the stranger's home. Strange, unsettling, and sending you down a rabbit hole, this original horror film deserves all the praise it received when it was first released.\u003c/p\u003e\n                \u003c/div\u003e\n                "]},"reco":[{"id":"b09096a6-98ee-4d01-9efb-174cf2d788b4","date":"Oct 3, 2022","author":"Brian Martin","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52401112067_bb1a1c6efc_o.png","title":"Why the King Kong speech from Training Day is one of the greatest movie monologues ever","tags":"movie news","excerpt":"In Training Day's King Kong announcement, Denzel Washington improvised the key sentence, but it was crucial."},{"id":"5fd80d5c-3cf0-4561-9756-1b3dcde0256e","date":"Sep 18, 2022","author":"Brian Martin","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52365853308_682f751031_o.png","title":"List of Best Evan Peters Movies and Tv Shows That You Should Watch","tags":"movie news","excerpt":"Over the course of his acting career, Evan Peters has portrayed a wide range of roles.
