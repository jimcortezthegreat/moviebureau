                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>The Brothers' journey appears to be intertwined with the MCU's own journey. The two Ohioan directors were once a bit of a gamble for Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige. They were young filmmakers who were better known for their television work on shows like Community and Arrested Development than for the kind of flashy Hollywood vehicles that used to lead to Hollywood blockbusters. Nevertheless, on Captain America: The Winter Soldier in 2013, the Russo family received the royal keys, and the rest is Marvel history: Captain America: Civil War (2016), Avengers: Infinity War (2018), and a small film called Avengers: Endgame (2019), which became the highest-grossing movie of all time upon its release.</p>

                <p>”The power of filmmaking is its ability to bind people together as a community in a public space, respective of background. And Marvel does that better than anyone, and I don’t think they get enough credit for that. And if that is the true power of what filmmaking is, then they’re certainly the most potent filmmaking entity on the planet because you go into one of those theaters, and, boy, there’s a lot of joy and happiness, and emotion, and excitement going on in one of their films. And you just don’t see that on any other movie. Even, historically, I’m not sure that you’ve seen that level of excitement on any film other than when Marvel’s operating at the top of their game.”</p>

                <p>“You connect with audiences in a way that allows you to understand the global impact of big release movies and you get a better window into the perspective of audiences who are outside of the U.S. and outside of that sort of Hollywood circle.

                <p>”To really understand inclusion, you have to remember that going to a movie theater is, in some regards, an elitist experience, right? It’s expensive. And outside of the U.S., a lot of people cannot afford it. A majority of audiences can’t afford it. There are certain countries you go to where going to a movie theater is a once in a lifetime experience. So you’re trying to deliver something to those audiences that is deserving of that time, that money they’re going to spend. Also it allows you to understand that putting barriers into your storytelling, whether they be faux-intellectual barriers in an attempt to create a niche appeal, that’s uninteresting to us, because it excludes a wider audience, and I would argue a more interesting audience.”</p>

And you just don’t see that on any other movie. Even, historically, I’m not sure that you’ve seen that level of excitement on any film other than when Marvel’s operating at the top of their game.”\u003c/p\u003e\n                \u003c/div\u003e\n                ","\n                \u003cdiv\u003e\n                \u003cp class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'\u003eJoe and Anthony agree that their time at Marvel opened their eyes to the true appeal of visual narrative to consumers, as opposed to what certain cultural gatekeepers may have led them to believe.\u003c/p\u003e\n                \u003c/div\u003e\n                ","\n                \u003cdiv class='ArticleBody_quote__9rdnr'\u003e\n                \u003cp\u003e“You connect with audiences in a way that allows you to understand the global impact of big release movies and you get a better window into the perspective of audiences who are outside of the U.S. and outside of that sort of Hollywood circle.

So you’re trying to deliver something to those audiences that is deserving of that time, that money they’re going to spend. Also it allows you to understand that putting barriers into your storytelling, whether they be faux-intellectual barriers in an attempt to create a niche appeal, that’s uninteresting to us, because it excludes a wider audience, and I would argue a more interesting audience.”\u003c/p\u003e\n                \u003c/div\u003e\n                ","\n                \u003cdiv\u003e\n                \u003cp class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'\u003eThe Gray Man will debut on Netflix on July 22 following a restricted theatrical run that starts on July 15.
