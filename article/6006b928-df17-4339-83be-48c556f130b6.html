                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>In this Netflix series, Park Seo-joon plays a hwarang, drawing on Korea's past. Hwarangs, also known as flower knights, were a prestigious order of male soldiers that served in the ancient Korean kingdom of Silla. In Hwarang: The Poet Warrior Youth, Queen Regent Jisu orders the formation of the Hwarang out of concern that nobles could profit from her abdicating the crown to her son, who has only recently reached adulthood.</p>

                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Fans of Park Seo-joon will be happy to hear that although this is a historical drama that draws inspiration from Korea, romance plays a significant role in the plot of his character, Kim Sun-woo, also known as Dog-Bird.

                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Do you enjoy seeing musical and dance performances? If so, Park Seo-joon also agrees. We follow a group of students and a few of promising young K-pop stars in this romantic comedy and adolescent drama. As a result of Kirin High's bankruptcy, Oz Entertainment assumes control of the institution at the start of the narrative.</p>
                </div>
                 
                <div>
                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>This is helpful to the agency since a recent rule mandates that minor performers must study for a set period of time each day and finish any booked jobs by 10 p.m. Naturally, rivalry and hostilities develop between the Kirin High students and the incoming Oz Entertainment pupils.</p>
                </div>
                 
                <div>
                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>What part does Park Seo-joon play in this intriguing tale? He naturally fulfills the role of Si-Woo, one of the budding K-pop singers, given his attractiveness and charm. He is a member of the idol boy band Eden, and the first few episodes portray him as a rebel as well. However, if you want to watch Park Seo-joon show off his dancing abilities and assume the persona of a rock star singer, this K-drama is for you. You don't get to witness what it would have been like for your favorite Korean actor to turn into a Korean star every day, too.</p>

If so, Park Seo-joon also agrees. We follow a group of students and a few of promising young K-pop stars in this romantic comedy and adolescent drama. As a result of Kirin High's bankruptcy, Oz Entertainment assumes control of the institution at the start of the narrative.\u003c/p\u003e\n                \u003c/div\u003e\n                ","\n                \u003cdiv\u003e\n                \u003cp class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'\u003eThis is helpful to the agency since a recent rule mandates that minor performers must study for a set period of time each day and finish any booked jobs by 10 p.m. Naturally, rivalry and hostilities develop between the Kirin High students and the incoming Oz Entertainment pupils.\u003c/p\u003e\n                \u003c/div\u003e\n                ","\n                \u003cdiv\u003e\n                \u003cp class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'\u003eWhat part does Park Seo-joon play in this intriguing tale? He naturally fulfills the role of Si-Woo, one of the budding K-pop singers, given his attractiveness and charm. He is a member of the idol boy band Eden, and the first few episodes portray him as a rebel as well. However, if you want to watch Park Seo-joon show off his dancing abilities and assume the persona of a rock star singer, this K-drama is for you. You don't get to witness what it would have been like for your favorite Korean actor to turn into a Korean star every day, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n                \u003c/div\u003e\n                "]},"reco":[{"id":"2cf6eba9-2f91-4424-8297-8a231d8b1875","date":"Sep 12, 2022","author":"Brian Martin","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52352016370_445e021036_o.png","title":"Can MCU's Secret Invasion Bring Back SHIELD?","tags":"tv news","excerpt":"Since Agents of SHIELD came to an end, SHIELD has not received much attention.
