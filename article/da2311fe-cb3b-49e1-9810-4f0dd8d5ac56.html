DiCaprio as Frank Abagnale, a juvenile conman so accomplished at his chosen profession that you can't help but be carried along by him, is light on his feet and plainly having the best of his life. Though the performance works best when he's having a breezy good time, DiCaprio always lets you see the scared kid beneath the surface – much of this stems from his sad-sack, brokenhearted father, played beautifully by Christopher Walken – DiCaprio smartly gives this rogue some heft, and though the performance works best when he's having a breezy good time, DiCaprio always lets you see the scared kid underneath the surface. (Tom Hanks is his perfect opposite in this regard: he's the everyman, the Frank Grimes, who can't believe this kid gets away with it all.) We'd love to see DiCaprio do something like this again: he fits in remarkably well when he lets himself go in the service of a brilliant director.</pre>

                </div> <pre class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Shutter Island, one of DiCaprio's most polarizing films, is an artfully unsettling picture of a guy progressively losing his shit. As U.S. marshal Teddy Daniels, who believes he's on the hunt for a missing inmate on an island for the criminally insane, DiCaprio must play his character's psychosis straight while implying the horrible truth: he's actually a patient, unable to accept the fact that his wife (Michelle Williams) murdered their children. Whether or not you enjoy Shutter Island's twist — we've argued before that it's completely irrelevant - the picture is truly about delving into the depths of agony and denial churning within this man, and DiCaprio is incandescent in that role, portraying all of Teddy's grief. Shutter Island is frequently compared to Alfred Hitchcock films, which is fitting given Leo's performance, which is comparable to that of Jimmy Stewart or Cary Grant, two previous Hollywood stars who bravely went dark while working with a master filmmaker.</pre>

                </div> <pre class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>This is DiCaprio's Cast Away, his All Is Lost. The Revenant, directed by Oscar winner Alejandro G. Iárritu, is a violent survival story about an 1820s frontiersman who survives a Native American ambush, a bear assault, and a betrayal by one of his colleagues (Tom Hardy), who abandons him for dead. Leo's character speaks few words, but in a story this primal, words don't matter: The Revenant is easily the most physically demanding performance of his career, with the actor grunting, straining, and battling his way back to civilization across terrible terrain. His Oscar win was yet another example of a well-respected actor receiving an Academy Award because he was "due" rather than for doing his best work — that is to say, The Revenant is great stuff, but it lacks the brilliant range of his most indelible roles because the performance has an unrelenting jackhammer intensity. Still, this could be the film that convinces some critics that DiCaprio lacks the physicality to play tough guys.</pre>

                </div> <pre class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Other than Leonardo DiCaprio, has there ever been a superb actor who is noticeably worse in a Quentin Tarantino film than he normally is? As villainous plantation owner Calvin Candie, Leo is fine, but the part isn't a natural match for him. He's a more physical performer than a vocal one, and while he does his best to project menacing, he's likely the fourth most compelling actor in his final moment. (Having him spar with Christoph Waltz, who appears to have been genetically made in a lab solely to recite Quentin Tarantino language, does him no favors.) It's a flamboyant character, but perhaps a little too showy, especially given Candie's entitlement and dependence on others. We hate to say it, but DiCaprio isn't quite right for this role. Would this even make the list of Tarantino's top 25 best performances? We don't believe so.</pre>

                </div> <pre class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Body of Lies is a rare commercial flop for DiCaprio, and it's second-tier Ridley Scott, which means it's stylish but without substance. Leo plays a CIA assassin on the hunt for a secret terrorist boss in Iraq and Jordan. At the same time, he's dealing with a romance subplot involving a Jordanian nurse (Golshifteh Farahani), which is designed to humanize a region's tensions but, once she's taken by the bad guys, becomes a manipulative story device. Body of Lies is a boring but competent piece of studio entertainment that tries to be smart about US–Middle East ties. It's a reunion with Leo's Quick and the Dead co-star Russell Crowe, whose CIA chief leads a cushy life back home in the States. Sure, DiCaprio brings enough grit and empathy to the character, but admit it: this is the one major film on this list where you forgot he was in it.</pre>

                </div> <pre class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>DiCaprio doesn't do message movies well – he's too shifty – so he's an odd match for Edward Zwick in this extremely preachy and stilted drama about "don't purchase African gems." DiCaprio chafes at the prospect of breaking free from the Reluctant Hero straitjacket that Zwick has placed him in. This is the kind of job Humphrey Bogart would have played 80 years ago, and DiCaprio isn't that kind of actor: he's too jittery to have that unearned but irrefutable arrogance. DiCaprio isn't the worst thing about this film – which has aged horribly, even if its message hasn't – but it is a character that appears to be outside of his comfort zone and strengths as an actor.</pre></div></article><div class="Article_cardContainer__5wwn2 Article_cardLine__jETl3"></div><div class="CardSmall_cardContainer___Oyfj"><div class="CardSmall_cardRow__Vpz6u"><img class="CardSmall_cardImg__rJYhb" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51999579280_96c97901cf_c.jpg" alt="tv news"/><div><p class="CardSmall_cardTag__NHgUi">tv news</p><a class="CardSmall_cardTitle__nHW3N" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="/article/405cd1ef-56c8-494e-a132-c735b50d2f1c">Moon Knight Cannot Defeat The Mandalorian In A Fight, According To Pedro Pascal</a><p class="CardSmall_cardExcerpt__oq5Je">Pedro Pascal joins the argument between Moon Knight and The Mandalorian, which was begun by Moon Knight star Oscar Isaac, and claims that his hero will triumph.</p><p class="CardSmall_cardDate__ifaop">Apr 12, 2022</p></div></div></div><div class="CardSmall_cardContainer___Oyfj"><div class="CardSmall_cardRow__Vpz6u"><img class="CardSmall_cardImg__rJYhb" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51997352443_38d85dc031_c.jpg" alt="movie news"/><div><p class="CardSmall_cardTag__NHgUi">movie news</p><a class="CardSmall_cardTitle__nHW3N" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="/article/062db741-dc24-4805-b849-f08c8a9941db">The Reunion of Doc Ock and Maguire in Spider-Man Made Alfred Molina Cry</a><p class="CardSmall_cardExcerpt__oq5Je">Alfred Molina, who featured with Tobey Maguire in Spider-Man 2, says that his reunion with Tobey Maguire, who he co-starred with in Spider-Man 2, made him weep.</p><p class="CardSmall_cardDate__ifaop">Apr 11, 2022</p></div></div></div><div class="CardSmall_cardContainer___Oyfj"><div class="CardSmall_cardRow__Vpz6u"><img class="CardSmall_cardImg__rJYhb" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51997523665_55c2a0f398_c.jpg" alt="movie news"/><div><p class="CardSmall_cardTag__NHgUi">movie news</p><a class="CardSmall_cardTitle__nHW3N" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="/article/34e061d6-e747-4446-87b6-9e6618fbf51e">The Best Filipino Movies That You Need To Watch</a><p class="CardSmall_cardExcerpt__oq5Je">In this article, we look into Filipino films and cinema, which is undoubtedly one of Southeast Asia&#x27;s most underrated businesses.</p><p class="CardSmall_cardDate__ifaop">Apr 11, 2022</p></div></div></div><div class="CardSmall_cardContainer___Oyfj"><div class="CardSmall_cardRow__Vpz6u"><img class="CardSmall_cardImg__rJYhb" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51997038444_e1d6e422c3_c.jpg" alt="tv news"/><div><p class="CardSmall_cardTag__NHgUi">tv news</p><a class="CardSmall_cardTitle__nHW3N" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="/article/6d8df57f-04ce-496f-b891-06c8208020ec">Season 4 Of Stranger Things Is Similar To Game Of Thrones, According To The Creators</a><p class="CardSmall_cardExcerpt__oq5Je">While discussing Stranger Things season 4, the Duffer Brothers make a comparison between the Netflix series and Game of Thrones.</p><p class="CardSmall_cardDate__ifaop">Apr 11, 2022</p></div></div></div><footer class="Footer_footer__ULcHT"><div class="Footer_container__qKZdZ"><div class="Footer_logoContainer__0o6Yh"><img layout="fixed" src="/logo.svg" alt="logo" href="/"/></div><div class="Footer_logoContainer__0o6Yh"><div class="Footer_linkContainer__NJC_u"><a class="Footer_links__WaOvo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="/">Home</a><a class="Footer_links__WaOvo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="/about">About</a><a class="Footer_links__WaOvo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="/contact">Contact</a><a class="Footer_links__WaOvo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="/privacy">Privacy</a><a class="Footer_links__WaOvo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="/terms">Terms</a></div></div></div></footer></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"article":{"id":"da2311fe-cb3b-49e1-9810-4f0dd8d5ac56","date":"Apr 4, 2022","author":"Nick Carver","title":"All Leonardo DiCaprio Movies You Can Watch on Netflix Right Now","excerpt":"Despite the fact that Leonardo DiCaprio has been one of the biggest movie stars for two decades and has grown up in front of audiences' eyes, there is still an unfathomable element to Leo.","keywords":"netlfix, Leonardo DiCaprio","tags":"movie news","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51981257166_cb88860fc2_c.jpg","content":["\u003cpre class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'\u003eWith a career like DiCaprio's, there's never a bad time to revisit his filmography.

Iárritu, is a violent survival story about an 1820s frontiersman who survives a Native American ambush, a bear assault, and a betrayal by one of his colleagues (Tom Hardy), who abandons him for dead. Leo's character speaks few words, but in a story this primal, words don't matter: The Revenant is easily the most physically demanding performance of his career, with the actor grunting, straining, and battling his way back to civilization across terrible terrain. His Oscar win was yet another example of a well-respected actor receiving an Academy Award because he was \"due\" rather than for doing his best work — that is to say, The Revenant is great stuff, but it lacks the brilliant range of his most indelible roles because the performance has an unrelenting jackhammer intensity. Still, this could be the film that convinces some critics that DiCaprio lacks the physicality to play tough guys.\u003c/pre\u003e","\n                \u003ch2 class=\"ArticleBody_heading__tc5g4\"\u003eDjango Unchained (2012)\u003c/h2\u003e\n                ","\n                \u003cdiv class='ArticleBody_imageContainer__ktXae'\u003e\n                \u003cimg src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51981522294_6cb308c6ac_z.jpg\" alt=\"netlfix, Leonardo DiCaprio\"\u003e\n                \u003c/div\u003e","\u003cpre class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'\u003eOther than Leonardo DiCaprio, has there ever been a superb actor who is noticeably worse in a Quentin Tarantino film than he normally is? As villainous plantation owner Calvin Candie, Leo is fine, but the part isn't a natural match for him. He's a more physical performer than a vocal one, and while he does his best to project menacing, he's likely the fourth most compelling actor in his final moment. (Having him spar with Christoph Waltz, who appears to have been genetically made in a lab solely to recite Quentin Tarantino language, does him no favors.) It's a flamboyant character, but perhaps a little too showy, especially given Candie's entitlement and dependence on others. We hate to say it, but DiCaprio isn't quite right for this role. Would this even make the list of Tarantino's top 25 best performances? We don't believe so.\u003c/pre\u003e","\n                \u003ch2 class=\"ArticleBody_heading__tc5g4\"\u003eBody of Lies (2008)\u003c/h2\u003e\n                ","\n                \u003cdiv class='ArticleBody_imageContainer__ktXae'\u003e\n                \u003cimg src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51981241321_319fcc0528.jpg\" alt=\"netlfix, Leonardo DiCaprio\"\u003e\n                \u003c/div\u003e","\u003cpre class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'\u003eBody of Lies is a rare commercial flop for DiCaprio, and it's second-tier Ridley Scott, which means it's stylish but without substance. Leo plays a CIA assassin on the hunt for a secret terrorist boss in Iraq and Jordan. At the same time, he's dealing with a romance subplot involving a Jordanian nurse (Golshifteh Farahani), which is designed to humanize a region's tensions but, once she's taken by the bad guys, becomes a manipulative story device. Body of Lies is a boring but competent piece of studio entertainment that tries to be smart about US–Middle East ties. It's a reunion with Leo's Quick and the Dead co-star Russell Crowe, whose CIA chief leads a cushy life back home in the States. Sure, DiCaprio brings enough grit and empathy to the character, but admit it: this is the one major film on this list where you forgot he was in it.\u003c/pre\u003e","\n                \u003ch2 class=\"ArticleBody_heading__tc5g4\"\u003eBlood Diamond (2006)\u003c/h2\u003e\n                ","\n                \u003cdiv class='ArticleBody_imageContainer__ktXae'\u003e\n                \u003cimg src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51980235542_b78bc265b9_k.jpg\" alt=\"netlfix, Leonardo DiCaprio\"\u003e\n                \u003c/div\u003e","\u003cpre class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'\u003eDiCaprio doesn't do message movies well – he's too shifty – so he's an odd match for Edward Zwick in this extremely preachy and stilted drama about \"don't purchase African gems.\" DiCaprio chafes at the prospect of breaking free from the Reluctant Hero straitjacket that Zwick has placed him in. This is the kind of job Humphrey Bogart would have played 80 years ago, and DiCaprio isn't that kind of actor: he's too jittery to have that unearned but irrefutable arrogance. DiCaprio isn't the worst thing about this film – which has aged horribly, even if its message hasn't – but it is a character that appears to be outside of his comfort zone and strengths as an actor.\u003c/pre\u003e"]},"reco":[{"id":"405cd1ef-56c8-494e-a132-c735b50d2f1c","date":"Apr 12, 2022","author":"Wallace Bell","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51999579280_96c97901cf_c.jpg","title":"Moon Knight Cannot Defeat The Mandalorian In A Fight, According To Pedro Pascal","tags":"tv news","excerpt":"Pedro Pascal joins the argument between Moon Knight and The Mandalorian, which was begun by Moon Knight star Oscar Isaac, and claims that his hero will triumph."},{"id":"062db741-dc24-4805-b849-f08c8a9941db","date":"Apr 11, 2022","author":"Nick Carver","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51997352443_38d85dc031_c.jpg","title":"The Reunion of Doc Ock and Maguire in Spider-Man Made Alfred Molina Cry","tags":"movie news","excerpt":"Alfred Molina, who featured with Tobey Maguire in Spider-Man 2, says that his reunion with Tobey Maguire, who he co-starred with in Spider-Man 2, made him weep."},{"id":"34e061d6-e747-4446-87b6-9e6618fbf51e","date":"Apr 11, 2022","author":"Andres Pineda","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51997523665_55c2a0f398_c.jpg","title":"The Best Filipino Movies That You Need To Watch","tags":"movie news","excerpt":"In this article, we look into Filipino films and cinema, which is undoubtedly one of Southeast Asia's most underrated businesses."},{"id":"6d8df57f-04ce-496f-b891-06c8208020ec","date":"Apr 11, 2022","author":"Wallace Bell","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51997038444_e1d6e422c3_c.jpg","title":"Season 4 Of Stranger Things Is Similar To Game Of Thrones, According To The Creators","tags":"tv news","excerpt":"While discussing Stranger Things season 4, the Duffer Brothers make a comparison between the Netflix series and Game of Thrones."}]},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/article/[id]","query":{"id":"da2311fe-cb3b-49e1-9810-4f0dd8d5ac56"},"buildId":"zraOoJn1bFSoJy9AzAX4-","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
