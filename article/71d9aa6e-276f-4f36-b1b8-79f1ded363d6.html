Despite the fact that Hardy's Venom was introduced to the MCU following Venom: Let There Be Carnage, his Spider-Man: No Way Home cameo ended with him being returned to his own realm. Despite appearing to tease that the line between the two universes will become more porous, it appears that the main goal was to build up a fresh Symbiote tale within the MCU, possibly for Spider-Man 4.</pre> <pre class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Espinosa is most likely referring to the other Spider-Man characters that will be released next in Sony's Spider-Man Universe.

A third Venom picture is also rumored to be in the works, with Hardy reprising his role. Despite the fact that the overall ending for Sony's franchise has remained a mystery, Morbius will almost certainly meet those individuals at some time.</pre></div></article><div class="Article_cardContainer__5wwn2 Article_cardLine__jETl3"></div><div class="CardSmall_cardContainer___Oyfj"><div class="CardSmall_cardRow__Vpz6u"><img class="CardSmall_cardImg__rJYhb" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51997352443_38d85dc031_c.jpg" alt="movie news"/><div><p class="CardSmall_cardTag__NHgUi">movie news</p><a class="CardSmall_cardTitle__nHW3N" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="/article/062db741-dc24-4805-b849-f08c8a9941db">The Reunion of Doc Ock and Maguire in Spider-Man Made Alfred Molina Cry</a><p class="CardSmall_cardExcerpt__oq5Je">Alfred Molina, who featured with Tobey Maguire in Spider-Man 2, says that his reunion with Tobey Maguire, who he co-starred with in Spider-Man 2, made him weep.</p><p class="CardSmall_cardDate__ifaop">Apr 11, 2022</p></div></div></div><div class="CardSmall_cardContainer___Oyfj"><div class="CardSmall_cardRow__Vpz6u"><img class="CardSmall_cardImg__rJYhb" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51997523665_55c2a0f398_c.jpg" alt="movie news"/><div><p class="CardSmall_cardTag__NHgUi">movie news</p><a class="CardSmall_cardTitle__nHW3N" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="/article/34e061d6-e747-4446-87b6-9e6618fbf51e">The Best Filipino Movies That You Need To Watch</a><p class="CardSmall_cardExcerpt__oq5Je">In this article, we look into Filipino films and cinema, which is undoubtedly one of Southeast Asia&#x27;s most underrated businesses.</p><p class="CardSmall_cardDate__ifaop">Apr 11, 2022</p></div></div></div><div class="CardSmall_cardContainer___Oyfj"><div class="CardSmall_cardRow__Vpz6u"><img class="CardSmall_cardImg__rJYhb" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51997038444_e1d6e422c3_c.jpg" alt="tv news"/><div><p class="CardSmall_cardTag__NHgUi">tv news</p><a class="CardSmall_cardTitle__nHW3N" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="/article/6d8df57f-04ce-496f-b891-06c8208020ec">Season 4 Of Stranger Things Is Similar To Game Of Thrones, According To The Creators</a><p class="CardSmall_cardExcerpt__oq5Je">While discussing Stranger Things season 4, the Duffer Brothers make a comparison between the Netflix series and Game of Thrones.</p><p class="CardSmall_cardDate__ifaop">Apr 11, 2022</p></div></div></div><div class="CardSmall_cardContainer___Oyfj"><div class="CardSmall_cardRow__Vpz6u"><img class="CardSmall_cardImg__rJYhb" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51996780953_7e35495503_c.jpg" alt="movie news"/><div><p class="CardSmall_cardTag__NHgUi">movie news</p><a class="CardSmall_cardTitle__nHW3N" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="/article/9a3f668d-e089-420d-8e6b-0f1249b897c2">Best Basketball Movies That You Should Start Watching</a><p class="CardSmall_cardExcerpt__oq5Je">Basketball on the big screen isn&#x27;t always a win, but when it comes to hoops in Hollywood, these films are the genuine MVPs.</p><p class="CardSmall_cardDate__ifaop">Apr 11, 2022</p></div></div></div><footer class="Footer_footer__ULcHT"><div class="Footer_container__qKZdZ"><div class="Footer_logoContainer__0o6Yh"><img layout="fixed" src="/logo.svg" alt="logo" href="/"/></div><div class="Footer_logoContainer__0o6Yh"><div class="Footer_linkContainer__NJC_u"><a class="Footer_links__WaOvo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="/">Home</a><a class="Footer_links__WaOvo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="/about">About</a><a class="Footer_links__WaOvo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="/contact">Contact</a><a class="Footer_links__WaOvo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="/privacy">Privacy</a><a class="Footer_links__WaOvo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="/terms">Terms</a></div></div></div></footer></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"article":{"id":"71d9aa6e-276f-4f36-b1b8-79f1ded363d6","date":"Mar 22, 2022","author":"Nick Carver","title":"Director Says Morbius Has Endless Marvel Crossover Possibilities.","excerpt":"Exclusive: Director Daniel Espinosa discusses potential future Marvel crossovers as Morbius becomes the latest film in Sony's Spider-Man Universe.","keywords":"mcu, sony, morbius, marvel","tags":"movie news","thumbnail":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51953436092_93676042cf_o.png","content":["\u003cpre class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'\u003eAs Morbius prepares to hit theaters, the filmmaker believes he's leaving the door open for a variety of potential Marvel crossovers.
