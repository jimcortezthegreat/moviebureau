                <p>Morbius takes place in what you would call the Sony-Verse. If you remember, when Sony released Spider-Verse, they introduced the idea of different timelines that then later Kevin Feige with Marvel took up. It is an idea that has existed within the studio for a long time. We are in what some people call the Venom-Verse. But these worlds have endless possibilities of interacting and trading people or information. Who knows what the future will hold?</p>

                 <pre class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Despite the three live-action Spider-triple-crossover Men's in Spider-Man: No Way Home, there's no certainty that Leto's Morbius will interact with any MCU character in the near future. Despite the fact that Hardy's Venom was introduced to the MCU following Venom: Let There Be Carnage, his Spider-Man: No Way Home cameo ended with him being returned to his own realm. Despite appearing to tease that the line between the two universes will become more porous, it appears that the main goal was to build up a fresh Symbiote tale within the MCU, possibly for Spider-Man 4.</pre> <pre class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Espinosa is most likely referring to the other Spider-Man characters that will be released next in Sony's Spider-Man Universe. While Aaron Taylor-Johnson is presently filming Kraven the Hunter as the eponymous character, Sony Pictures is preparing to release Dakota Johnson's Madame Web. A third Venom picture is also rumored to be in the works, with Hardy reprising his role. Despite the fact that the overall ending for Sony's franchise has remained a mystery, Morbius will almost certainly meet those individuals at some time.</pre></div></div><div class="Article_cardContainer__5wwn2 Article_cardLine__jETl3"></div><div class="CardSmall_cardContainer___Oyfj"><div class="CardSmall_cardRow__Vpz6u"><img class="CardSmall_cardImg__rJYhb" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51954465213_c3c845a0e3_o.png" alt="movie news"/><div><p class="CardSmall_cardTag__NHgUi">movie news</p><a class="CardSmall_cardTitle__nHW3N" href="/article/0b1f2130-832a-414e-9277-722c96bc52a9">The Sequel To &#x27;godzilla Vs.
