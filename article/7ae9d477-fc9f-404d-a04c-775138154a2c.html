                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>Holland, who plays a very unfortunate young guy who must deal with corruption and nasty people in a tiny rural village, is a perfect illustration of how skilled and varied he can be.

                <div>
                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>It's difficult to believe that Holland's captivating portrayal as the eponymous web-slinger didn't play a significant part in Homecoming being one of the most well-received Marvel movies to date, both with critics and moviegoers.

                <p class='ArticleBody_text__ePgSJ'>With both Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire reprising their Spider-Man roles in this breathtaking celebration of three generations of film, No Way Home was unquestionably the cinematic event of 2021. Holland's first trilogy has a terrific finish, and it also serves as a sort of atonement for how the other two actors' tenure as the role ended.</p>
